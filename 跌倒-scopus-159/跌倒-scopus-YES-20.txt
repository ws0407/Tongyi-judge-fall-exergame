[Title]    Effect of virtual reality training on risk of falls and quality of life among elderly.
[Journal]  Fizjoterapia Polska 21(5): 138-143.
[Abstract] Purpose. One of the fall risk factors associated with aging is the deterioration of postural stability. This study aimed to evaluate the effects of Virtual Reality Training (VRT) on the risk of falls, and quality of life among elderly. Methods. Thirty-five community-dwelling elderly aged 65 to70 years from both genders were included in the study. Participant were randomly assigned into two groups; VRT group: included 30 participants and were provided with VRT sessions using Xbox 360 Kinect. Each session was determined to be for 30 minutes; 5 days weekly throughout the program period which was 6 weeks (30 sessions in total). The Control group: included 10 participants, they were advised to follow conventional balance exercises. The dynamic postural stability was assessed using the overall stability index (OSI) of Biodex and the Functional reach test (FRT) before and immediately after the program for all the participants. And 36-items short form (SF-36) Questionnaire was employed to evaluate the general health quality of life. Results. The overall balance showed statistically significant improvements after VRT. Results revealed significant improvement of OSI and FRT (p < 0.05) after VRT. Also, the results demonstrated significant improvements in levels of general health quality of life after the VRT compared with those of the Control group (p < 0.05). Conclusion. VRT improves overall postural stability and general health quality of life and can help reduce the risk of falls in healthy older adults. © 2021, DJ Studio. All rights reserved.

[Title]    Single or Multiplayer Mode? Examining the Effects of Exergames in Improving Physical Health and Well-Being Among Older Adults.
[Journal]  GAMES FOR HEALTH JOURNAL.
[Abstract] Objective: This study assesses the impact of single-player and multiplayer exergaming modes on improving exercise intentions, reduction of fear of falling, and emotional well-being among older adults, primarily from low socioeconomic status (SES) backgrounds—a group often underrepresented in exergame research. Method: We engaged 48 participants, primarily from low-SES communities in Singapore for a 4-week community-based exergaming intervention. Participants were divided into four groups as follows: (1) conventional exercise alone, (2) exergames alone, (3) exergames with a health coach, and (4) exergames with a peer. Using two-way repeated-measures ANOVA, we analyzed the effects of these interventions. Results: The findings revealed that all exergaming modes positively influenced exercise intentions, fear of falling, and emotional well-being to varying extents. Notably, exergaming with a health coach significantly improved participants’ exercise intentions and emotional well-being, underscoring the value of expert guidance in motivating and supporting older adults in adopting healthier lifestyles. Exergaming with a peer was most effective in reducing fear of falling, highlighting the importance of social support and peer interaction in addressing physical health concerns among this population. Conclusion: This study emphasizes the potential of tailored exergame interventions incorporating various social interactions to improve health outcomes for older adults, contributing to more inclusive health promotion strategies. © Mary Ann Liebert, Inc.

[Title]    Effectiveness of feedback-based technology on physical and cognitive abilities in the elderly.
[Journal]  FRONTIERS IN AGING NEUROSCIENCE 14.
[Abstract] Aging raises a social and health challenge because the passing of time causes changes in cognitive and physical functions that impair functionality and quality of life. In addition, advancements in technology and information technology have led to the development of new techniques for retraining based on the feedback technology provides. To solve the negative consequences of aging, a randomized clinical trial was carried out to assess the effectiveness of a protocol using feedback-based technology to improve physical and cognitive functions in older adults. For the purpose of this study, 200 patients were selected from a Social and Community Services Center in the province of Seville and only 46 of them became participants of the study (after applying the inclusion criteria). These patients were divided into two groups: control and experimental. Physical and cognitive abilities were assessed using the Miniexamen cognoscitivo Test (an adaptation of the MiniMental examination test), Yesevage’s Depression Scale, Oddball Test, Attention Network Test, Berg Scale, Tinetti Scale, and Timed Up and Go Test. The intervention applied to the experimental group consisted of a supervised protocol using the Nintendo® Wii video game console and the Wii-Fit© video game during 16 sessions, 2 times a week with a duration of 30 min per session. The control group did not receive any treatment. The experimental group showed statistically significant improvements in all the physical variables (balance, gait, autonomy, and fall risk), as other authors had proven, and in memory and reaction times; there were no improvements in attention networks. The control group (placebo) even showed a decrease in their functions, with worse results on the Timed up and Go test Scale. The intervention using feedback-based technology has been proven effective in improving physical and cognitive abilities and in preventing and promoting healthy aging.

[Title]    Falls risk in relation to activity exposure in high-risk older adults.
[Journal]  Journals of Gerontology - Series A Biological Sciences and Medical Sciences 75(6): 1198-1205.
[Abstract] Background: Physical activity is linked to many positive health outcomes, stimulating the development of exercise programs. However, many falls occur while walking and so promoting activity might paradoxically increase fall rates, causing injuries, and worse quality of life. The relationship between activity exposure and fall rates remains unclear. We investigated the relationship between walking activity (exposure to risk) and fall rates before and after an exercise program (V-TIME). Methods: One hundred and nine older fallers, 38 fallers with mild cognitive impairment (MCI), and 128 fallers with Parkinson's disease (PD) were randomly assigned to one of two active interventions: treadmill training only or treadmill training combined with a virtual reality component. Participants were tested before and after the interventions. Free-living walking activity was characterized by volume, pattern, and variability of ambulatory bouts using an accelerometer positioned on the lower back for 1 week. To evaluate that relationship between fall risk and activity, a normalized index was determined expressing fall rates relative to activity exposure (FRA index), with higher scores indicating a higher risk of falls per steps taken. Results: At baseline, the FRA index was higher for fallers with PD compared to those with MCI and older fallers. Walking activity did not change after the intervention for the groups but the FRA index decreased significantly for all groups (p = .035). Conclusions: This work showed that V-TIME interventions reduced falls risk without concurrent change in walking activity. We recommend using the FRA index in future fall prevention studies to better understand the nature of intervention programs. © The Author(s) 2020.

[Title]    The effects of exergaming on pain, postural control, technology acceptance and flow experience in older people with chronic musculoskeletal pain: A randomised controlled trial.
[Journal]  BMC Sports Science, Medicine and Rehabilitation 12(1).
[Abstract] Background: Older people with chronic musculoskeletal pain are at risk of falls. This study aimed to investigate the effects of exergaming on pain and postural control in older people with chronic musculoskeletal pain. Secondary outcomes were technology acceptance, flow experience, perceived physical exertion, expended mental effort and heart rate. Methods: Fifty four older adults (age: 71 ± 5 years) with chronic musculoskeletal pain were randomised into 2 groups. Group 1 received exergaming training using the Interactive Rehabilitation and Exercise System (IREX®). Group 2 undertook traditional gym-based exercise (TGB). Both groups completed twice weekly 40-min exercise sessions for 6 weeks. Perceived pain was measured using a numeric pain rating scale and the Multidimensional Affect and Pain Survey questionnaire. Postural control was measured as sway using a Kistler™ force platform. Technology acceptance was measured with the Unified Theory of Acceptance and Use of Technology questionnaire and flow experience with the Flow State Scale. Physiological measures of perceived physical exertion, expended mental effort and heart rate were recorded during all sessions. Results: The exergaming group demonstrated significant reductions in pain intensity and thermal pain including a near significant approach in physical engagement in comparison to TGB group. Although no intervention effects on postural control were found, the exergaming group showed significant improvements in three sway measures (AP SD, ML SD and AP range) over time whereas significant improvements in ML range were found in the TGB group. Relating to technology acceptance, significant intervention effects on social influence and behavioural intention were found in the TGB group instead, although both groups demonstrated increases of acceptance over time. Regarding flow experience, concentration at task was significantly influenced in the TGB group and significant increases in flow variables over time were observed in both groups. Significant increases over time in perceived physical exertion and expended mental effort were found in both groups. Conclusion: Our findings support the potential of exergaming to alleviate pain and improve balance in older people with chronic musculoskeletal pain. Both forms of exercise are acceptable, intrinsically motivating and show evidence of benefit to older people with chronic musculoskeletal pain.

[Title]    Effectiveness and sustainability of a motor-cognitive stepping exergame training on stepping performance in older adults: A randomized controlled trial.
[Journal]  EUROPEAN REVIEW OF AGING AND PHYSICAL ACTIVITY 17(1).
[Abstract] Background: Training effects reported for stepping exergames on stepping performances in older adults often based on not comprehensively validated outcomes measures, and follow-up data on their sustainability are lacking. The aim of this study is to evaluate the effectiveness and sustainability of a motor-cognitive stepping exergame training on the stepping performance in older adults. Methods: Fifty-eight older adults (78.3 ± 6.5 years) participated in the randomized controlled trial with a 10-week intervention and 10-week follow-up period. The intervention group (IG: n = 29) took part in a once-weekly exercise program including strength and balance exercises supplemented with an additional stepping exergame training. The control group (CG: n = 29) only performed the strength and balance exercises. Outcome measures included stepping reaction times (SRTs) and games scores for individual stepping exergame levels and for the overall exergame performance, as measured by an assessment strategy previously validated in older adults. Results: SRTs and/or games scores for 7 out of 10 levels and the overall exergame performance significantly improved in the IG compared to the CG during the intervention (p ≤ 0.001-0.039, η p2 = 0.090-0.445). Training gains were sustained for 2 levels and for the overall exergame performance (p = 0.017-0.033, η p2 = 0.127-0.193). Conclusion: The study demonstrates that the additional stepping exergame training effectively and sustainably improves the performance in complex motor-cognitive stepping exergame tasks in older adults, which can be relevant for preventing falls. Future research is needed to evaluate the effectiveness of such training on reducing the number of falls.

[Title]    Protocol for a controlled, randomized, blind, clinical trial to assess the effects of transcranial direct current stimulation associated with balance training using games in the postural balance of elderly people.
[Journal]  F1000Research 9.
[Abstract] Aims: This study aims to evaluate the additional effect of transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS) on training postural balance with the use of video games in aged. Methods: This is a blinded, randomized, controlled clinical trial protocol, with elderly people of both genders. Participants will be randomized into three training groups: Group 1 (videogame balance training), group 2 (videogame balance training associated with active tDCS), group 3 (videogame balance training associated with sham tDCS). The training will be carried out twice a week for four weeks, totaling eight sessions, and will be performed with the Nintendo Wii videogame console, using games that stimulate the postural balance associated with tDCS, with anode applied over the left dorsolateral prefrontal cortex and cathode on the contralateral supraorbital region at 2 mA for 20 minutes. The postural balance will be assessed using the Mini Test of the Balance Assessment System and posturography. Evaluations will be carried out before and after eight training sessions and 30 days after the end of treatment. Discussion: Some studies show favorable results from the use of video games in improving postural balance in the elderly; however, their effect does not remain long-term. TDCS associated with other therapies can potentiate and prolong the effects of these therapies owing to its ability to stimulate neurotrophins important for neurogenesis, facilitating tasks that require attention, and helping to consolidate learning and memory. The effect of the two associated techniques on balance have not yet been tested in this population.

[Title]    Effects of WiiActive exercises on fear of falling and functional outcomes in community-dwelling older adults: A randomised control trial.
[Journal]  AGE AND AGEING 45(5): 621-628.
[Abstract] Background: the study compares the effects of a Nintendo Wii exercise programme and a standard Gym-based exercise intervention on fear of falling, knee strength, physical function and falls rate in older adults.Methods: eighty community-dwelling adults aged 60 years and above with short physical performance battery score of 5-9 points and modified falls efficacy scale (MFES) score of ≤9 points participated in the parallel-group randomised trial. Each intervention arm involved an hour of intervention per week, totalling 12 sessions over 12 weeks. Besides 1-year fall incidence, the participants were evaluated on MFES, knee extensor strength (KES), timed-up-and-go test, gait speed, 6-minute walk test and narrow corridor walk test at weeks 13 and 24.Results: at week 13, between interventions, the effect of MFES changes did not reach statistical significance (difference = -0.07 point, 95% CI -0.56 to 0.42, P = 0.78); at week 24, the Wii group showed statistically significant effects over the Gym group (difference = 0.8 point, 95% CI 0.27 to 1.29, P < 0.01). For KES, the two groups did not differ statistically at week 13 (difference = -2.0%, 95% CI -5.6 to -1.7, P = 0.29); at week 24, the Gym group had greater strength gains than the Wii group (difference = -5.1%, 95% CI -8.7 to -1.5, P < 0.01). No between-group differences were observed for other outcome measures.Conclusion: on completion of a 12-week Nintendo Wii exercise programme, there was no significant benefit seen on fear of falling when compared to a standard Gym-based exercise intervention; however, post-intervention there was an apparent reduction in fear of falling in the group allocated to Wii training, despite knee strength apparently improving more in those allocated to the Gym. It is possible that long-term gains after using the Wii might be due to a carry-over effect. © The Author 2016. Published by Oxford University Press on behalf of the British Geriatrics Society.

[Journal]  Activities, Adaptation and Aging 38(1): 53-69.
[Abstract] Gait characteristics serve as indicators of fall risk. Exercise interventions have been shown to improve gait. However, the use of interactive video games with biofeedback to reduce fall risk has not been well explored. Eighty-two older adults were randomly assigned to either a traditional fitness or Wii group. Both 10-week interventions involved 45-minute exercise sessions (3 days per week). Pre- and post-testing gait measurements were taken. Both groups significantly improved velocity, stride length, cadence, swing time, and decreased double support time (p <.05). Interactive video games offer a promising alternative to traditional group exercise for older adults. © Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.

[Title]    Effects of virtual reality-based physical and cognitive training on executive function and dual-task gait performance in older adults with mild cognitive impairment: A randomized control trial.
[Journal]  FRONTIERS IN AGING NEUROSCIENCE 10(JUL).
[Abstract] Background: Walking while performing cognitive and motor tasks simultaneously interferes with gait performance and may lead to falls in older adults with mild cognitive impairment (MCI). Executive function, which seems to play a key role in dual-task gait performance, can be improved by combined physical and cognitive training. Virtual reality (VR) has the potential to assist rehabilitation, and its effect on physical and cognitive function requires further investigation. The purpose of this study was to assess the effects of VR-based physical and cognitive training on executive function and dual-task gait performance in older adults with MCI, as well as to compare VR-based physical and cognitive training with traditional combined physical and cognitive training. Method: Thirty-four community-dwelling older adults with MCI were randomly assigned into either a VR-based physical and cognitive training (VR) group or a combined traditional physical and cognitive training (CPC) group for 36 sessions over 12 weeks. Outcome measures included executive function [Stroop Color and Word Test (SCWT) and trail making test (TMT) A and B], gait performance (gait speed, stride length, and cadence) and dual-task costs (DTCs). Walking tasks were performed during single-task walking, walking while performing serial subtraction (cognitive dual task), and walking while carrying a tray (motor dual task). The GAIT Up system was used to evaluate gait parameters including speed, stride length, cadence and DTCs. DTC were defined as 100 * (single-task gait parameters − dual-task gait parameters)/single-task gait parameters. Results: Both groups showed significant improvements in the SCWT and single-task and motor dual-task gait performance measures. However, only the VR group showed improvements in cognitive dual-task gait performance and the DTC of cadence. Moreover, the VR group showed more improvements than the CPC group in the TMT-B and DTC of cadence with borderline significances. Conclusion: A 12-week VR-based physical and cognitive training program led to significant improvements in dual-task gait performance in older adults with MCI, which may be attributed to improvements in executive function. © 2019 Liao, Chen, Lin, Chen and Hsu.

[Title]    Design of virtual reality training program for prevention of falling in the elderly: A pilot study on complex versus balance exercises.
[Journal]  EUROPEAN JOURNAL OF INTEGRATIVE MEDICINE 15: 64-67.
[Abstract] Introduction Virtual reality (VR) exercises have been investigated as a rehabilitation paradigm to reduce the risk of falling in the elderly. This study aimed to compare a VR program consisted of complex exercises and that of balance exercises. Methods The study was a single-blind, randomized, comparative trial conducted over 5 weeks. Twenty subjects over 65 years of age were divided into a complex exercise with virtual reality (CEVR) group and a balance exercise with virtual reality (BEVR) group. CEVR consisted of strengthening, flexibility, endurance, and balance exercises, while BEVR focused on balance exercises only. Before and after 10 times of 1 h training sessions, we measured isokinetic peak torque and total work of knee muscles using a dynamometer. The Timed Up & Go (TUG) test was also conducted to evaluate dynamic balance. Results Knee extension peak torque was significantly enhanced only in the CEVR group (p < 0.05), but there was no difference between groups. Both groups showed significant improvement of dynamic balance measured by TUG after training sessions, but the CEVR group exhibited greater improvement than the BEVR group (p < 0.05). Conclusions Our findings demonstrate the superiority of the virtual reality training with a complex exercise program to improve balance and muscle strength in the elderly when compared to the BEVR. As a training for prevention of falling in the elderly, we recommend a virtual reality program including various exercises for strength, endurance, balance, and flexibility. © 2017

[Title]    Effects of Exergaming-Based Tai Chi on Cognitive Function and Dual-Task Gait Performance in Older Adults With Mild Cognitive Impairment: A Randomized Control Trial.
[Journal]  FRONTIERS IN AGING NEUROSCIENCE 14.
[Abstract] Background: Declined cognitive function interferes with dual-task walking ability and may result in falls in older adults with mild cognitive impairment (MCI). The mind-body exercise, Tai Chi (TC), improves cognition and dual-task ability. Exergaming is low-cost, safe, highly scalable, and feasible. Whether the effects of exergaming-based TC is beneficial than traditional TC has not been investigated yet. Objectives: The objective of this study was to investigate effects of exergaming-based TC on cognitive function and dual-task walking among older adults with MCI. Methods: Fifty patients with MCI were randomly assigned to an exergaming-based TC (EXER-TC) group, a traditional TC (TC) group, or a control group. The EXER-TC and TC groups received 36 training sessions (three, 50-min sessions per week) during a 12-week period. The control group received no intervention and were instructed to maintain their usual daily physical activities. The outcome variables measured included those related to cognitive function, dual-task cost (DTC), and gait performance. Results: The EXER-TC and TC groups performed better than the control group on the Chinese version of the Stroop Color and Word Test, the Trail Making Test Parts A and B, the one-back test, gait speed, and DTC of gait speed in cognitive dual-task conditions after training. However, there were no significant differences between the EXER-TC and TC groups. Compared with the control group, only the EXER-TC group experienced beneficial effects for the Montreal Cognitive Assessment. Conclusion: EXER-TC was comparable to traditional TC for enhancement of dual-task gait performance and executive function. These results suggested that the EXER-TC approach has potential therapeutic use in older adults with MCI. Copyright © 2022 Liu, Cheng, Wei and Liao.

[Title]    The effect of balance therapy on postural stability in a group of seniors using active video games (Nintendo wii).
[Journal]  Journal of Physical Education and Sport 17(2): 735-739.
[Abstract] Impaired postural stability increases the risk of falls. Therefore, the aim of this study was to analyse the lasting effects of a training intervention using a Nintendo Wii system on impaired postural stability in an elderly population. Thirty-two elderly subjects (24 females and 4 males) from two independent living communities were divided into Wii Fit (n = 15, 9 therapy sessions using Wii Fit balance board) and control (n = 13) groups. All participants performed three different stances on force plates, which are considered the gold standard for measuring balance performance. Each stance was measured three times in the following sequence: a natural bipedal stance with eyes open, a bipedal stance with a narrow base, and a natural bipedal stance with eyes closed. One-way analysis of variance (ANOVA) and LSD Fisher’s post hoc tests were used with the level of significance set at 5%. Effect size was determined using ŋ². The results showed a significant difference in the centre of pressure velocity in the anterior-posterior direction between the baseline and post-treatment measurements (post-intervention and follow up) for all measured conditions in Wii Fit Group. The control group did not show any significant differences between measurements. The results of this study suggest that using the Nintendo Wii is an effective physical activity for improving balance in the elderly and that the effects of balance therapy on postural stability persist for several weeks after intervention. © JPES.

[Title]    Effects of a “modified” otago exercise program on the functional abilities and social participation of older adults living in the community—the aga@4life model.
[Journal]  INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL RESEARCH AND PUBLIC HEALTH 17(4).
[Abstract] Strength and balance exercises form part of multifactorial programs to reduce the risk of falling and promote active ageing. The aim of this study was to evaluate the effect of a strength and balance exercise program, adapted from the traditional Otago Exercise Program (OTAGO) into a technological system. A non-randomized experimental study enrolled 34 participants (83.24 ± 6.89 years) from a daycare center in Portugal, who were distributed into an intervention group (IG; 18 participants) and a control group (CG; 16 participants). The IG underwent a “modified” OTAGO incorporated in a technological system using pressure and inertial sensors, feedback, and Exergames for 8 weeks, 3 times a week. The CG continued their regular activities. Outcome measures were evaluated at baseline and after 8 weeks of intervention. After the program, differences were observed between the groups in handgrip strength (p = 0.03), step test (p = 0.03), 4stage balance test “modified” (p < 0.001) and activities and participation profile related to mobility (PAPM) (p < 0.001). The IG showed positive results in the self-efficacy for exercise (p = 0.03), PAPM (p = 0.00) and all functional tests, except for timed up and go (p = 0.35). No significant changes were observed in the CG. The results support this intervention program as a good exercise solution to improve functional abilities, social participation, and self-efficacy, reducing the risk of falling. © 2020 by the authors.

[Answer]   YES
[Response] NO. The paper describes an intervention that includes the use of exergames and technology to improve functional abilities and social participation in older adults. However, it does not meet the criteria for the answer "YES" because the study is a non-randomized experimental study, not a randomized controlled trial. Additionally, while the intervention involves exergames, the primary focus is on a modified version of the Otago Exercise Program, which is a strength and balance exercise program. Therefore, the paper does not fully meet all the specified criteria.

[Title]    Effect of virtual running with exercise on functionality in pre-frail and frail elderly people: randomized clinical trial.
[Journal]  AGING CLINICAL AND EXPERIMENTAL RESEARCH 35(7): 1459-1467.
[Abstract] Background: Virtual mirror therapies could increase the results of exercise, since the mirror neuron system produces an activation of motor execution cortical areas by observing actions performed by others. In this way, pre-frail and frail people could use this system to reach an exercise capacity threshold and obtain health benefits. Aim: The aim of this study is to evaluate the effects of a virtual running (VR) treatment combined with specific physical gait exercise (PE) compared to placebo VR treatment combined with PE on functionality, pain, and muscular tone in pre-frail and frail older persons. Methods: A single blinded, two-arm, randomised controlled trial design was employed. Thirty-eight participants were divided into two intervention arms: Experimental Intervention (EI) group, in which VR and gait-specific physical exercises were administered and Control Intervention (CI) group, in which a placebo virtual gait and the same exercise programme was administered. Functionality, pain, and tone were assessed. Results: EI group improved in aerobic capacity, functional lower-limb strength, reaction time, and pain, while CI group remained the same. Regarding static balance and muscle tone, no differences were found for either group. Further analysis is needed to asses VR effectiveness for improving gait, stand-up and sit-down performance and velocity. Conclusions: Virtual running therapy appears to enhance capacities related with voluntary movements (i.e., aerobic capacity, functional lower-limb strength, and reaction time) and reduce pain. © 2023, The Author(s).

[Title]    Study protocol of a randomized clinical trial evaluating the effectiveness of a primary care intervention using the Nintendo™ Wii console to improve balance and decrease falls in the elderly Physical functioning, physical health and activity.
[Journal]  BMC GERIATRICS 16(1).
[Abstract] Background: Balance alteration is a risk factor for falls in elderly individuals that has physical, psychological and economic consequences. The objectives of this study are to evaluate the usefulness of an intervention utilizing the Nintendo™ Wii console in order to improve balance, thereby decreasing both the fear of falling as well as the number of falls, and to evaluate the correlation between balance as determined by the console and the value obtained in the Tinetti tests and the one foot stationary test. Methods/Design: This is a controlled, randomized clinical trial of individual assignment, carried out on patients over 70 years in age, from five primary care centers in the city of Mataró (Barcelona). 380 patients were necessary for the intervention group that carried out the balance board exercises in 2 sessions per week for a 3 month period, and 380 patients in the control group who carried out their usual habits. Balance was evaluated using the Tinetti test, the one foot stationary test and with the console, at the start of the study, at the end of the intervention (3 months) and one year later. Quarterly telephone follow-up was also conducted to keep track of falls and their consequences. Discussion: The study aimed to connect the community with a technology that may be an easy and fun way to assist the elderly in improving their balance without the need to leave home or join rehabilitation groups, offering greater comfort for this population and decreasing healthcare costs since there is no need for specialized personnel.

[Title]    Effects of dance exergaming on depressive symptoms, fear of falling, and musculoskeletal function in fallers and nonfallers community-dwelling older women.
[Journal]  REJUVENATION RESEARCH 21(6): 518-526.
[Abstract] The aim of this study was to evaluate the effects of a pop dance exergaming protocol on fall risk factors - depressive symptoms, fear of falling, and musculoskeletal function - in community-dwelling older female fallers and nonfallers. There were 47 community-dwelling older women assigned to the intervention group (IG) [fallers (n = 10, 69.8 ± 4.3 years); nonfallers (n = 12, 68.9 ± 3.3 years)] and the control group (CG) [fallers (n = 12, 73.6 ± 5.4 years); nonfallers (n = 13, 68.7 ± 4.8 years)]. The CG maintained their lifestyle and the IG performed a videogame dance training three times per week for 12 weeks. The Dance Central game for Xbox 360® and Kinect motion sensor were used. The primary outcomes were geriatric depressive symptoms, fear of falling, and concentric and eccentric isokinetic peak torque (PT) of quadriceps and hamstrings. Secondary outcomes included cross-sectional area of quadriceps and hamstring muscles, functionality (Timed Up and Go test, gait speed, the Five Times Sit-to-Stand test), and a fall circumstances and outcomes recording. The depressive symptoms decreased in the Intervention Fallers Group. The eccentric hamstrings PT at 180°/s increased in the Intervention Nonfallers Group. There were no significant differences between groups for the other variables analyzed. The training attendance was 83% for the Intervention Fallers Group and 88% for the Intervention Nonfallers Group. Dance exergaming can be indicated to decrease depressive symptoms in fallers and increase the PT in nonfallers among community-dwelling older women. © Mary Ann Liebert, Inc., publishers 2018.

[Title]    Effects of Mat Exergame-Based Multicomponent Training on the Standing Balance of Community-Dwelling Older Adults With and Without Fall Risk.
[Journal]  GAMES FOR HEALTH JOURNAL 11(3): 186-192.
[Abstract] Objective: Exergames may enhance postural stability and prevent falls. This study investigated the effects of mat exergame-based multicomponent training on the static and dynamic standing balance capacities of community-dwelling older adults. Materials and Methods: Study participants comprised 34 community-dwelling older adults who were assigned into the high-risk group (yes to at least one question) or low-risk group (no to all three questions) based on the 3-item subset of a fall risk questionnaire. A 2-hour Stampede mat exergaming, including resistance, aerobics, flexibility, and balance training, was completed weekly for 3 months. The postural stability test, fall risk test, limits of stability (LOS) test, and the modified clinical test of sensory interaction and balance were conducted using the Biodex Balance System SD before and after the intervention. Intervention effects within and between groups were compared. Results: After the intervention, significant improvements in the fall risk index (FRI, P = 0.007) and overall stability index (OSI, P = 0.008) were observed in the high-risk group (n = 18; mean age, 71.0 ± 4.7 years). Medium effect sizes (ESs) were noted in the low-risk group (n = 16; mean age, 70.8 ± 4.4 years) for the FRI (ES = 0.35), OSI (ES = 0.43), and LOS (ES = 0.40-0.45). The change scores were not different between groups. Conclusion: Mat exergame-based multicomponent training is effective in enhancing the standing balance. Exergame-based intervention is recommended for balance training among older adults. © 2022, Mary Ann Liebert, Inc., publishers.

[Title]    Effects of Kinect exergames on balance training among community older adults: A randomized controlled trial.
[Journal]  Medicine (United States) 99(28): E21228.
[Abstract] Background:Recent years have witnessed wide applications of exergames to balance training among the older adults. However, research concerning balance training with the use of Kinect for Xbox has remained scarce. While previous studies have shown the positive effects of exergames on improving balance and preventing falling among the older adults, there has been a paucity of empirical evidence supporting the superiority of Kinect exercise to conventional exercise over balance training among the older adults. Therefore, this study aimed to compare the feasibility, safety, and effectiveness of Kinect exercise against conventional exercise over balance training among the community older adults.Method:A total of 20 participants were randomly assigned to the Kinect Exercise Group (N = 10) or the Conventional Exercise Group (N = 10) for a 5-week balance training (45 minutes a time, 2 times a week). Assessor blinding was employed to assess the participants' performance before and after the treatment, including 30-Second Chair Stand Test (30-sec CST), Timed Up and Go (TUG), Functional Reach Test (FRT), and One-Leg Stance Test (OLST) respectively with eyes open and closed. Subjective feeling of the intensity of pain and side effects were recorded throughout the investigation period. Nonparametric statistics was used for data analysis.Results:Within-group comparison between the pre-Test and post-Test indicated that significant differences existed in all of the 5 tests (30-sec CST, TUG, FRT, OLST with eyes open, and OLST with eyes closed) in the Kinect exercise group. To the Conventional exercise group, however, significant differences were only observed in 30-sec CST, FRT and OLST with eyes open. With regard to between-group comparison, significant differences were only found in FRT.Conclusion:Such results indicated that both treatments were helpful in improving the participants' balance performance, that Kinect exercise was more effective in terms of overall balance ability, and that Kinect exercise was particularly beneficial to functional reach enhancement in comparison with traditional exercise. Kinect exercise could be a feasible, safe, and effective alternative for dynamic balance training among older adults. © 2020 Lippincott Williams and Wilkins. All rights reserved.

[Title]    The effectiveness of virtual reality exercise games on balance functions and fear of falling in women with osteoporosis.
[Journal]  RHEUMATOLOGY INTERNATIONAL 44(6): 1071-1076.
[Abstract] To investigate and compare the effectiveness of Nintendo Wii games and home exercises on balance functions in patients with osteoporosis, an important disease adversely affecting balance functions. The patients included in the study were randomized into two groups the Wii exercise group (n = 30) and the home exercise group (n = 30). Wii exercise group performed balance exercises with a Nintendo Wii device and balance board three times a week for 12 weeks under the supervision of a physiotherapist in the hospital, and home exercise group was prescribed home exercises three days a week for 12 weeks. Balance functions were evaluated with the timed up-and-go-test and Berg Balance Scale, and the fall risk was evaluated with the Falls Efficacy Scale at the beginning and end of 12 weeks of treatment. Comparison of pre- and post-treatment timed up-and-go-test, Berg Balance Scale, and Falls Efficacy Scale results in both groups revealed statistically significant improvements (p = 0.001; p < 0.05). Furthermore, post-treatment test scores between the two groups demonstrated a significant enhancement in Wii exercise group regarding the Berg Balance Scale score (Mean ± SD 52.9 ± 3.63) (p = 0.001; p < 0.05). Within the osteoporotic population, balance functions serve as robust predictors of fall risk. Improvement in balance functions is crucial for the prevention of falls and subsequent osteoporotic fractures. In our study, we found that balance exercises performed with Wii games are effective in improving balance functions in patients with osteoporosis. © The Author(s) 2024.
