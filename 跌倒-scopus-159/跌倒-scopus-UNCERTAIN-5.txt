[Title]    Cross-frequency modulation of postural fluctuations and scalp EEG in older adults: error amplification feedback for rapid balance adjustments.
[Journal]  GEROSCIENCE 46(6): 5599-5613.
[Abstract] Virtual error amplification (VEA) in visual feedback enhances attentive control over postural stability, although the neural mechanisms are still debated. This study investigated the distinct cortical control of unsteady stance in older adults using VEA through cross-frequency modulation of postural fluctuations and scalp EEG. Thirty-seven community-dwelling older adults (68.1 ± 3.6 years) maintained an upright stance on a stabilometer while receiving either VEA or real error feedback. Along with postural fluctuation dynamics, phase–amplitude coupling (PAC) and amplitude–amplitude coupling (AAC) were analyzed for postural fluctuations under 2 Hz and EEG sub-bands (theta, alpha, and beta). The results revealed a higher mean frequency of the postural fluctuation phase (p =.005) and a greater root mean square of the postural fluctuation amplitude (p =.003) with VEA compared to the control condition. VEA also reduced PAC between the postural fluctuation phase and beta-band EEG in the left frontal (p =.009), sensorimotor (p =.002), and occipital (p =.018) areas. Conversely, VEA increased the AAC of posture fluctuation amplitude and beta-band EEG in FP2 (p =.027). Neither theta nor alpha band PAC or AAC were affected by VEA. VEA optimizes postural strategies in older adults during stabilometer stance by enhancing visuospatial attentive control of postural responses and facilitating the transition of motor states against postural perturbations through a disinhibitory process. Incorporating VEA into virtual reality technology is advocated as a valuable strategy for optimizing therapeutic interventions in postural therapy, particularly to mitigate the risk of falls among older adults. © The Author(s), under exclusive licence to American Aging Association 2024.
[Answer]   UNCERTAIN
[Response] UNCERTAIN. The paper does involve older adults and a form of virtual feedback (VEA) that could be related to exergames, but it is not explicitly stated that the intervention is an exergame. The study focuses on the neural mechanisms and postural control using visual error amplification, and while it suggests that VEA could be incorporated into virtual reality technology for therapeutic interventions, it does not clearly meet the criteria of being an exergame. Additionally, the study reports results from a specific experimental setup, but it is not clear if it was a randomized controlled trial. Therefore, based on the given abstract, it is uncertain whether the paper fully meets all the specified criteria.

[Title]    Effects of virtual dance exercise on skeletal muscle architecture and function of community dwelling older women.
[Journal]  Journal of Musculoskeletal Neuronal Interactions 19(1): 50-61.
[Abstract] Objectives: The aim of this study was to analyze the effects of virtual dance exercise on skeletal muscle architecture and function in community-dwelling older women. Methods: Forty-two moderately active older women participated in this study and chose to join either the control group (CG; n=20; 70.3 ± 5.6 years) or exercise group (EG; n=22; 69.3 ± 3.7 years). Participants in the CG maintained their lifestyle and those in the EG performed group dance exercise using Dance Central game for Xbox 360® and Kinect for 40 min, 3 times/week, for 12 weeks. The primary outcomes were: ankle plantar flexion and dorsiflexion peak torque (PT), medial gastrocnemius muscle thickness (MT), fascicle length (FL), and pennation angle (PA). The secondary outcomes were: lower limbs range of motion (ROM), calf circumference (CC), 6 m customary gait speed, and handgrip strength. Data were analyzed using an ANOVA mixed model test (p < 0.05). Results: EG participants improved plantar flexion PT at 60º/s (16.3%; p<0.01), MT (8.7%; p<0.01) and ankle dorsiflexion ROM (5.1%; p=0.04) when compared to baseline, and exhibited enhanced CC values compared to CG (1.7%; p=0.03). Conclusions: Virtual dance exercise can be recommended to increase muscle mass. Moreover, ankle plantar flexion strength and dorsiflexion ROM gains may contribute to improve functionality and fall avoidance in moderately active older women. © 2019, International Society of Musculoskeletal and Neuronal Interactions.

[Answer]   UNCERTAIN
[Response] **UNCERTAIN**. ### Explanation:
- **Target Population (Criterion 1):** The study targets community-dwelling older women, which meets the first criterion.
- **Intervention (Criterion 2):** The intervention involves a virtual dance exercise using the Dance Central game for Xbox 360® and Kinect, which can be considered an exergame.
- **Study Design (Criterion 3):** The study is a randomized controlled trial, and the results are reported. However, the primary focus of the study is on skeletal muscle architecture and function, rather than directly on fall prevention.
- **Secondary Outcomes:** While the study does mention that the gains in ankle plantar flexion strength and dorsiflexion ROM may contribute to improved functionality and fall avoidance, this is not the primary focus or outcome of the study.. Given that the primary outcomes do not directly address fall prevention, the answer is **UNCERTAIN**.

[Title]    Evaluation of a rehabilitation system for the elderly in a day care center.
[Journal]  Information (Switzerland) 10(1).
[Abstract] This paper presents a rehabilitation system based on a customizable exergame protocol to prevent falls in the elderly population. The system is based on depth sensors and exergames. The experiments carried out with several seniors, in a day care center, make it possible to evaluate the usability and the efficiency of the system. The outcomes highlight the user-friendliness, the very good usability of the developed system and the significant enhancement of the elderly in maintaining a physical activity. The performance of the postural response is improved by an average of 80%. © 2018 by the author.
[Answer]   UNCERTAIN
[Response] UNCERTAIN. The abstract indicates that the study involves an exergame-based rehabilitation system for the elderly, which is aimed at preventing falls. However, it does not explicitly state that the study is a randomized controlled trial (RCT) and the results are reported in the context of such a trial. The focus seems to be more on evaluating the usability and efficiency of the system, rather than reporting the results of a formal RCT. Therefore, based on the given criteria, the answer is "UNCERTAIN."

[Title]    Combining exergame training with omega-3 fatty acid supplementation: Protocol for a randomized controlled study assessing the effect on neuronal structure/function in the elderly brain.
[Journal]  FRONTIERS IN AGING NEUROSCIENCE 8(NOV).
[Abstract] A common problem in the older population is the risk of falling and related injury, immobility, and reduced survival. Age-related neuronal changes, e.g., decline in gray-and white-matter, affect neuronal, cognitive, and motor functioning. The improvement of these factors might decrease fall events in elderly. Studies showed that administration of video game-based physical exercise, a so-called exergame, or omega-3 fatty acid (FA) may improve motor and/or cognitive functioning through neuronal changes in the brain of older adults. The aim of this study is to assess the effects of a combination of exergame training with omega-3 FA supplementation on the elderly brain. We hypothesize that an intervention using a combination approach differently affects on the neuronal structure and function of the elderly's brain as compared to the sole administration of exergame training. The study is a parallel, double-blinded, randomized controlled trial lasting 26 weeks. Sixty autonomous living, non-smoking, and right-handed healthy older (>65 years) adults who live independently or in a senior residency are included, randomized, and allocated to one of two study groups. The experimental group receives a daily amount of 13.5 ml fish oil (including 2.9 g of omega-3 FA), whereas the control group receives a daily amount of 13.5 ml olive oil for 26 weeks. After 16 weeks, both groups start with an exergame training program three times per week. Measurements are performed on three time-points by treatment blinded investigators: pre-intervention measurements, blood sample after 16 week, and post-intervention measurements. The main outcomes are motor evoked potentials of the right M. tibialis anterior (transcranial magnetic stimulation) and response-related potentials (electroencephalography) during a cognitive test. For secondary outcomes, reaction time during cognitive tests and spatio-temporal parameters during gait performance are measured. Statistics will include effect sizes and a 2 × 2-ANOVA with normally distributed data or the non-parametric equivalent for data not fulfilling normal distribution. The randomized controlled study is the first to investigate the effectiveness of exergame training combined with omega-3 FA in counteracting age- and behavioral-dependent neuronal changes in the brain.

[Answer]   UNCERTAIN
[Response] UNCERTAIN. Explanation:
- The intervention targets older people, which meets the first criterion.
- The intervention includes exergame training, meeting the second criterion.
- The study is a randomized controlled trial, and results are expected to be reported, potentially meeting the third criterion. However, the abstract indicates that this is a protocol for a study, meaning the results have not yet been reported at the time of publication.
- The paper is not a meta-analysis, review, or feasibility analysis without original data, so it does not fall under the exclusion criteria.. Given that the paper is a protocol and the results are not yet available, it is uncertain whether the final published study will fully meet all the criteria, particularly the requirement for reported results. Therefore, the answer is "UNCERTAIN."

[Title]    Effects of physical training with the Nintendo Wii Fit Plus® and protein supplementation on musculoskeletal function and the risk of falls in pre-frail older women: Protocol for a randomized controlled clinical trial (the WiiProtein study).
[Journal]  MATURITAS 111: 53-60.
[Abstract] Background: Frailty is one of the key geriatric syndromes and is related to the loss of functional independence. However, the practice of physical training (PT) combined with protein supplementation (PS) may improve musculoskeletal function (MF). Objective: To verify the effect of PT using ‘exergames’ with or without PS on MF, nutritional status, and risk of falls in pre-frail older women. Method: The protocol is for a randomized controlled clinical trial with a sample of pre-frail older women, divided into 5 groups: control group; PT using exergames; PS; PT using exergames combined with PS; PT using exergames combined with isoenergetic supplementation. The primary outcomes will be: the strength and power of the lower limbs, assessed by isokinetic dynamometer and the sit-and-stand test carried out 5 times; muscle architecture, assessed by ultrasound; body composition, assessed by anthropometric measurements, bioelectrical impedance and dual energy X-ray absorptiometry; and functional mobility and risk of falls, assessed using the Timed-Up and Go test. The secondary outcomes will be: centre of pressure (CoP), assessed using a force plate; and fear of falling, assessed using the Falls Efficacy Scale – International, Brazil. PT using exergames with a gradual increase in the mass weighted vest will be carried out twice a week for 50 min over 3 months. The supplements will be ingested 5 days a week for 3 months. All outcomes will be assessed before and after 3 months. Discussion: The WiiProtein study will be the first clinical trial to examine the effects of PT using exergames with progressive resistance, which may or may not be combined with PS, on MF, nutritional status, and risk of falls in pre-frail older women. © 2018 Elsevier B.V.
[Answer]   UNCERTAIN
[Response] **UNCERTAIN**. ### Explanation:
- **Target Population**: The study targets pre-frail older women, which meets the first criterion.
- **Intervention**: The intervention includes physical training using exergames (Nintendo Wii Fit Plus®), which meets the second criterion.
- **Study Design**: The paper describes a protocol for a randomized controlled clinical trial, but it does not report the results of the trial. This is a key point: the abstract is about the design and planned outcomes, not the actual results of the trial.. Since the paper is a protocol and does not include the results of the randomized controlled trial, it does not fully meet the criteria for inclusion. Therefore, the answer is "UNCERTAIN."
