[Title]    Effects of an In-home Multicomponent Exergame Training on Physical Functions, Cognition, and Brain Volume of Older Adults: A Randomized Controlled Trial.
[Journal]  FRONTIERS IN MEDICINE 6.
[Abstract] Aging is associated with a decline in physical functions, cognition and brain structure. Considering that human life is based on an inseparable physical-cognitive interplay, combined physical-cognitive training through exergames is a promising approach to counteract age-related impairments. The aim of this study was to assess the effects of an in-home multicomponent exergame training on [i] physical and cognitive functions and [ii] brain volume of older adults compared to a usual care control group. Thirty-seven healthy and independently living older adults aged 65 years and older were randomly assigned to an intervention (exergame training) or a control (usual care) group. Over 16 weeks, the participants of the intervention group absolved three home-based exergame sessions per week (a 30-40 min) including Tai Chi-inspired exercises, dancing and step-based cognitive games. The control participants continued with their normal daily living. Pre- and post-measurements included assessments of physical (gait parameters, functional muscle strength, balance, aerobic endurance) and cognitive (processing speed, short-term attention span, working memory, inhibition, mental flexibility) functions. T1-weighted magnetic resonance imaging was conducted to assess brain volume. Thirty-one participants (mean age = 73.9 +/- 6.4 years, range = 65-90 years, 16 female) completed the study. Inhibition and working memory significantly improved post-intervention in favor of the intervention group [inhibition: F-(1) = 2.537, p = 0.046, np2 = 0.11, working memory: F-(1) = 5.872, p = 0.015, np2 = 0.02]. Two measures of short-term attentional span showed improvements after training in favor of the control group [F-(1) = 4.309, p = 0.038, np2 = 0.03, F-(1) = 8.504, p = 0.004, np2 = 0.04]. No significant training effects were evident for physical functions or brain volume. Both groups exhibited a significant decrease in gray matter volume of frontal areas and the hippocampus over time. The findings indicate a positive influence of exergame training on executive functioning. No improvements in physical functions or brain volume were evident in this study. Better adapted individualized training challenge and a longer training period are suggested. Further studies are needed that assess training-related structural brain plasticity and its effect on performance, daily life functioning and healthy aging.
[Answer]   UNCERTAIN
[Response] UNCERTAIN. While the paper does meet some of the criteria—targeting older people, using an exergame intervention, and reporting results from a randomized controlled trial—it does not explicitly mention the prevention of falls as a primary or secondary outcome. The focus is on physical and cognitive functions, as well as brain volume, but fall prevention is not directly addressed. Therefore, based on the given criteria, the answer is "UNCERTAIN."

[Title]    Balance Training in Older Adults Using Exergames: Game Speed and Cognitive Elements Affect How Seniors Play.
[Journal]  FRONTIERS IN SPORTS AND ACTIVE LIVING 2.
[Abstract] Falls in older adults are a serious threat to their health and independence, and a prominent reason for institutionalization. Incorrect weight shifts and poor executive functioning have been identified as important causes for falling. Exergames are increasingly used to train both balance and executive functions in older adults, but it is unknown how game characteristics affect the movements of older adults during exergaming. The aim of this study was to investigate how two key game elements, game speed, and the presence of obstacles, influence movement characteristics in older adults playing a balance training exergame. Fifteen older adults (74 & PLUSMN; 4.4 years) played a step-based balance training exergame, designed specifically for seniors to elicit weight shifts and arm stretches. The task consisted of moving sideways to catch falling grapes and avoid obstacles (falling branches), and of raising the arms to catch stationary chickens that appeared above the avatar. No steps in anterior-posterior direction were required in the game. Participants played the game for eight 2 min trials in total, at two speed settings and with or without obstacles, in a counterbalanced order across participants. A 3D motion capture system was used to capture position data of 22 markers fixed to upper and lower body. Calculated variables included step size, step frequency, single leg support, arm lift frequency, and horizontal trunk displacement. Increased game speed resulted in a decrease in mean single support time, step size, and arm lift frequency, and an increase in cadence, game score, and number of error messages. The presence of obstacles resulted in a decrease in single support ratio, step size, cadence, frequency of arm lifts, and game score. In addition, step size increased from the first to the second trial repetition. These results show that both game speed and the presence of obstacles influence players' movement characteristics, but only some of these effects are considered beneficial for balance training whereas others are detrimental. These findings underscore that an informed approach is necessary when designing exergames so that game settings contribute to rather than hinder eliciting the required movements for effective balance training.
[Answer]   UNCERTAIN
[Response] UNCERTAIN. Reasoning:
- The paper does focus on older adults and uses an exergame for balance training, which meets criteria (1) and (2).
- However, the abstract does not explicitly mention that the study is a randomized controlled trial (RCT). It describes an experimental setup but does not clearly state that it follows the RCT methodology, which is required by criterion (3).
- The paper appears to be an original research study, not a meta-analysis, review, or feasibility analysis, so it meets the exclusion criteria in (4).. Given the lack of explicit mention of an RCT, the answer is "UNCERTAIN."

[Title]    The Effectiveness of Home-Based Exergames Training on Cognition and Balance in Older Adults: A Comparative Quasi-Randomized Study of Two Exergame Interventions.
[Journal]  INNOVATION IN AGING 7(8).
[Abstract] Background and Objectives: The effectiveness of exergames on fall risk and related physical and cognitive function in older adults is still unclear, with conflicting findings. The discrepancy in these results could be due to the different components and task-specific demands of individual exergame interventions. This open-label quasi-randomized study aimed to compare the efficacy of 2 different home-based dual-task exergame treatments on cognition, mobility, and balance in older people.Research Design and Methods: Fifty older adults (65-85 years of age) were allocated to one of two 8-week exergame interventions: Cognitive-Intensive Exergame Training (CIT) or Physical-Intensive Exergame Training (PIT). Cognitive functions, balance, and mobility were assessed at baseline and after 8 weeks. Group x time interaction was measured by repeated-measure ANOVA, and both intention-to-treat (ITT) and per-protocol (PP) analyses were performed to assess the effectiveness of exergame interventions.Results: ITT analyses showed that improvement in visual processing speed and visuospatial working memory was greater in the CIT group, with a medium effect size (p = .04; eta(2) = 0.09 and p = .01; eta(2) = 0.12). The improvement in verbal memory and attention was significant within both groups (p < .05), but this improvement was not different between the groups (p > .05). A significant improvement in balance was also observed in the PIT group, with a medium effect size (p = .04; eta(2) = 0.09). Although mobility improved significantly in both groups (p < .01), there was no significant difference between groups (p = .08). These results were largely supported by the PP analysis.Discussion and Implications: Dual-task exergame training can improve mobility and cognition in older adults. However, the different cognitive and physical demands of these interventions may have varying impacts on fall risk and related physical or cognitive functions. Therefore, a training program that includes both cognitive and physical domains with appropriate intensity is essential for the development of tailored exergame interventions to reduce fall risk in older adults.
[Answer]   UNCERTAIN
[Response] UNCERTAIN. ### Explanation:
- Intervention Targets: The study targets older adults (65-85 years of age), which meets the first criterion.
- Intervention Type: The intervention involves exergames, specifically two different types: Cognitive-Intensive Exergame Training (CIT) and Physical-Intensive Exergame Training (PIT). This meets the second criterion.
- Study Design: The study is a quasi-randomized study, not a randomized controlled trial (RCT). While it does report results, the design does not fully meet the third criterion, which specifies RCTs.
- Type of Paper: The paper is an original research study, not a meta-analysis, review, or feasibility analysis, so it meets the fourth criterion.. Given that the study is quasi-randomized rather than a fully randomized controlled trial, the answer is UNCERTAIN.

[Title]    Xbox Kinect training to improve clinical measures of balance in older adults: a pilot study.
[Journal]  AGING CLINICAL AND EXPERIMENTAL RESEARCH 28(3): 451-457.
[Abstract] Background Falls are a leading cause of injury and death for old adults, with one risk factor for falls being balance deficits. The low cost (<400 USD), wide availability, and ability to incorporate multiple training paradigms make gaming systems appealing as possible balance intervention tools.Aims To investigate the feasibility of using the Xbox Kinect for training to improve clinical measures of balance in old adults and retain improvements after a period of time.Methods Thirteen healthy old adults (aged 70+ years) were randomly divided into two groups. The experimental group completed Kinect training three times a week for 3 weeks while the control group continued with normal activities. Four clinical measures of balance were assessed before training, 1 week and 1 month after training: Berg balance scale (BBS), Fullerton advanced balance (FAB) scale, functional reach (FR), and timed up and go (TUG).Results The ability to implement the training program was successful. The experimental group significantly increased their BBS and FAB after training while the control group did not. There was no significant change for either groups with FR and TUG.Conclusion A training program using the Kinect with commercially available games was feasible with old adults. Kinect training may be an inexpensive way for old adults to receive helpful feedback encouraging them to continue with balance training program in their home.
[Answer]   UNCERTAIN
[Response] UNCERTAIN. Explanation:
- The intervention targets older adults, which meets the first criterion.
- The intervention uses the Xbox Kinect, a form of exergame, which meets the second criterion.
- The study is a pilot study and includes a randomized controlled trial, which partially meets the third criterion. However, the term "pilot study" suggests that it may not be a full-scale RCT with comprehensive results.
- The paper does not appear to be a meta-analysis, review, or feasibility analysis without original data, but it is specifically described as a "pilot study," which might not fully meet the criteria for a full RCT.. Given these points, the answer is "UNCERTAIN" because while the study meets many of the criteria, the description as a "pilot study" introduces some ambiguity about whether it fully meets the requirement for a full-scale RCT.

[Title]    Feasibility, safety, and effects of a Nintendo Ring Fit Adventure™ balance and strengthening exercise program in community-dwelling older adults with a history of falls: A feasibility randomized controlled trial.
[Journal]  GERIATRICS & GERONTOLOGY INTERNATIONAL 24: 334-341.
[Abstract] AimThis pilot study examined the feasibility, safety, and effects of a Nintendo Ring Fit Adventure (TM)-based exercise program to enhance balance and lower limb muscle strength in community-dwelling older adults with a history of falls.MethodsIn total, 42 older adults who experienced at least one fall in the past year were randomly assigned to an experimental or control group. Participants in the experimental group performed 60-min sessions of the exercise program twice per week for 8 weeks. The control group received usual care. We assessed the feasibility (retention and adherence to the exercise program), safety (number of adverse events), and clinical outcomes: (1) balance (Mini-BESTest); (2) functional lower limb muscle strength (Five-Time Sit-to-Stand test); (3) mobility (Timed-Up and Go test); (4) dual-task ability (Timed-Up and Go test - Dual Task); (5) fear of falling (Icon-FES); and (6) executive function (Color Trails Test).ResultsThirty-one participants (74%) completed the 8-week assessment. No adverse event associated with the exercise program was reported. There was a significant interaction in the anticipatory domain score of the Mini-BESTest between the experimental and control groups over the 8 weeks (P = 0.019).ConclusionsThe Nintendo Ring Fit Adventure (TM)-based exercise program was feasible, safe, and potentially effective in improving anticipatory balance in community-dwelling older fallers. Geriatr Gerontol Int 2023; center dot center dot: center dot center dot-center dot center dot.Our pilot study aimed to examine the feasibility, safety, and effects of a Nintendo Ring Fit Adventure (TM)-based exercise program in community-dwelling older adults with a history of falls. The results showed that the program was feasible, safe, and potentially effective in improving anticipatory balance in this population.image
[Answer]   UNCERTAIN
[Response] UNCERTAIN. While the paper does target older people and uses an exergame (Nintendo Ring Fit Adventure™) as the intervention, it is specifically described as a "feasibility randomized controlled trial." The focus of the study is on the feasibility, safety, and preliminary effects of the program, rather than reporting the full results of a randomized controlled trial. Therefore, it does not fully meet the criteria for inclusion based on the given guidelines.

[Title]    Cross-frequency modulation of postural fluctuations and scalp EEG in older adults: error amplification feedback for rapid balance adjustments.
[Journal]  GEROSCIENCE 46(6): 5599-5613.
[Abstract] Virtual error amplification (VEA) in visual feedback enhances attentive control over postural stability, although the neural mechanisms are still debated. This study investigated the distinct cortical control of unsteady stance in older adults using VEA through cross-frequency modulation of postural fluctuations and scalp EEG. Thirty-seven community-dwelling older adults (68.1 +/- 3.6 years) maintained an upright stance on a stabilometer while receiving either VEA or real error feedback. Along with postural fluctuation dynamics, phase-amplitude coupling (PAC) and amplitude-amplitude coupling (AAC) were analyzed for postural fluctuations under 2 Hz and EEG sub-bands (theta, alpha, and beta). The results revealed a higher mean frequency of the postural fluctuation phase (p = .005) and a greater root mean square of the postural fluctuation amplitude (p = .003) with VEA compared to the control condition. VEA also reduced PAC between the postural fluctuation phase and beta-band EEG in the left frontal (p = .009), sensorimotor (p = .002), and occipital (p = .018) areas. Conversely, VEA increased the AAC of posture fluctuation amplitude and beta-band EEG in FP2 (p = .027). Neither theta nor alpha band PAC or AAC were affected by VEA. VEA optimizes postural strategies in older adults during stabilometer stance by enhancing visuospatial attentive control of postural responses and facilitating the transition of motor states against postural perturbations through a disinhibitory process. Incorporating VEA into virtual reality technology is advocated as a valuable strategy for optimizing therapeutic interventions in postural therapy, particularly to mitigate the risk of falls among older adults.
[Answer]   UNCERTAIN
[Response] UNCERTAIN. The paper does involve older adults and uses a form of virtual feedback (VEA) to enhance postural stability, which is related to fall prevention. However, the study does not explicitly state that it is an exergame. Exergames typically involve interactive physical activities or games, and while VEA is a form of virtual feedback, it is not clear from the abstract if it fits the definition of an exergame. Additionally, the study focuses on the neural mechanisms and postural control, and it is not specified whether this was a randomized controlled trial. Therefore, based on the given criteria, the answer is UNCERTAIN.

[Title]    Validation of an immersive virtual reality device accepted by seniors that preserves the adaptive behavior produced in the real world.
[Journal]  FRONTIERS IN BIOENGINEERING AND BIOTECHNOLOGY 10.
[Abstract] Falls in the elderly are a major societal issue. Virtual reality appears as a relevant tool to propose gait training programs to prevent the occurrence of falls. The use of a head-mounted display allows overground walking during fully immersive virtual training sessions. Our long-term ambition is to develop gait training programs with a head-mounted display to propose enjoyable and personalized training content for the elderly. Before proposing these programs, several methodological precautions must be taken. The first concerns the supposed similarity of the adaptive behavior produced in the real world and in virtual reality. The second concerns the acceptance of the virtual reality device before and after use. Twenty older adults performed a locomotor pointing task in three conditions including a real-world condition, a virtual-world condition consisting in a replica of the real-world condition, and a virtual condition in which the locomotor pointing task was performed in a different context. From feet positions in relation to the position of a target, gait adaptability behavior was investigated. In line with previous studies, step adjustments (needed and produced) were investigated through a combination of inter-trial and trial-by-trial analyses. The results highlighted that participants adopted the same gait adaptability behavior whatever the type of environment (real vs. virtual). Gait analyses suggested the use of a generic control mechanism based on information-movement coupling. We also demonstrated that older adults accepted the virtual reality device before and after use. With these methodological locks removed, it is now possible to design training programs in virtual reality to prevent falls in the elderly.
[Answer]   UNCERTAIN
[Response] UNCERTAIN. Explanation:
- The paper targets older adults, which meets the first criterion.
- The intervention involves the use of a head-mounted display for virtual reality, which can be considered an exergame, meeting the second criterion.
- The study is not explicitly described as a randomized controlled trial (RCT). The abstract mentions a comparison between real-world and virtual conditions but does not specify that it is an RCT. This is a key point of uncertainty.
- The paper appears to be more focused on validating the similarity of adaptive behavior in real and virtual environments and the acceptance of the VR device, rather than reporting the results of a fall prevention program. . Given these points, especially the lack of clear indication of an RCT, the answer is "UNCERTAIN."

[Title]    Effects of 4 Weeks of Active Exergames Training on Muscular Fitness in Elderly Women.
[Journal]  JOURNAL OF STRENGTH AND CONDITIONING RESEARCH 36(2): 427-432.
[Abstract] Gallardo-Meza, C, Simon, K, Bustamante-Ara, N, Ramirez-Campillo, R, Garcia-Pinillos, F, Keogh, JWL, and Izquierdo, M. Effects of 4 weeks of active exergames training on muscular fitness in elderly women. J Strength Cond Res 36(2): 427-432, 2022-To analyze the effects of 4 weeks of an active exergames training program on muscular fitness in older women, 2 groups of community dwelling physically active subjects were formed by block-design randomization. One was deemed the control group (CG, n = 37; age 68.1 +/- 3.3 years), and a second group completed 4 weeks of an active exergames training program (ExG, n = 35; age, 69.2 +/- 3.7 years). Training included active exergames (Wii Fit Plus) performed on the Wii Balanceboard, 2 sessions per week. The exergames required mainly balance-related movements, such as leaning forward, leftward, and rightward, also requiring isometric squat positions and explosive leg extension. A supervisor-to-subject ratio method of 2:1 was used. An intensity-based individual progressive overload was applied. There were no significant (all p > 0.05, d = 0.01-0.07) baseline differences between-groups for all dependent variables. For the ExG, significant improvements were observed in static balance right leg test (Delta 75.5%, d = 0.89), static balance left leg (Delta 33.7%, d = 0.57), timed up-and-go test (Delta 14.8%, d = 0.85) and sit-to-stand velocity test (Delta 83.8%, d = 1.62). For the control group, trivial to small decrements in performance were observed across all tests (Delta -2.1 to -8.4%, d = -0.08 to 0.32). Group x time interactions were observed for the static balance right and left leg, timed up-and-go test, and the mean velocity achieved in the 5-repetition sit-to-stand test (all p < 0.001; d = 0.33-0.60). In conclusion, exergames training improves muscular fitness in older women. These results should be considered when designing appropriate and better exercise training programs for older women.
[Answer]   UNCERTAIN
[Response] UNCERTAIN. While the paper does involve an exergame intervention (Wii Fit Plus) and targets older women, it primarily focuses on improving muscular fitness rather than specifically preventing falls. The outcomes measured include static balance, timed up-and-go test, and sit-to-stand velocity, which are related to fall risk, but the primary aim is not explicitly stated as fall prevention. Therefore, based on the given criteria, the answer is "UNCERTAIN."

[Title]    Effects of virtual dance exercise on skeletal muscle architecture and function of community dwelling older women.
[Journal]  JOURNAL OF MUSCULOSKELETAL & NEURONAL INTERACTIONS 19(1): 50-61.
[Abstract] Objectives: The aim of this study was to analyze the effects of virtual dance exercise on skeletal muscle architecture and function in community-dwelling older women. Methods: Forty-two moderately active older women participated in this study and chose to join either the control group (CG; n=20; 70.3 +/- 5.6 years) or exercise group (EG; n=22; 69.3 +/- 3.7 years). Participants in the CG maintained their lifestyle and those in the EG performed group dance exercise using Dance Central game for Xbox 360 (R) and Kinect for 40 min, 3 times/week, for 12 weeks. The primary outcomes were: ankle plantar flexion and dorsiflexion peak torque (PT), medial gastrocnemius muscle thickness (MT), fascicle length (FL), and pennation angle (PA). The secondary outcomes were: lower limbs range of motion (ROM), calf circumference (CC). 6 m customary gait speed. and handgrip strength. Data were analyzed using an ANOVA mixed model test (p < 0.05). Results: EG participants improved plantar flexion PT at 60 degrees/s (16.3%; p<0.01). MT (8.7%; p<0.01) and ankle dorsiflexion ROM (5.1%; p=0.04) when compared to baseline, and exhibited enhanced CC values compared to CG (1.7%; p=0.03). Conclusions: Virtual dance exercise can be recommended to increase muscle mass. Moreover, ankle plantar flexion strength and dorsiflexion ROM gains may contribute to improve functionality and fall avoidance in moderately active older women.
[Answer]   UNCERTAIN
[Response] UNCERTAIN. The paper involves older women and uses a form of exergame (virtual dance exercise using Dance Central for Xbox 360 and Kinect). However, the primary focus is on skeletal muscle architecture and function, and while it mentions that the gains in ankle plantar flexion strength and dorsiflexion ROM may contribute to fall avoidance, it does not explicitly state that the study was designed to prevent falls. Additionally, the paper does not mention a randomized controlled trial; instead, participants chose which group to join. Therefore, based on the given criteria, the answer is "UNCERTAIN."

[Title]    Are exergames promoting mobility an attractive alternative to conventional self-regulated exercises for elderly people in a rehabilitation setting? Study protocol of a randomized controlled trial.
[Journal]  BMC GERIATRICS 15.
[Abstract] Background: Maintaining mobility in elderly persons has become a primary goal within healthcare services. In older adults, exercise programs significantly reduce the risk of falling and death. Long-lasting and high-intensive multi-component exercises are most effective. In a rehabilitation setting, self-regulated exercises are conventionally taught by physiotherapists, using handouts. However, the adherence of elderly persons to executing these self-administered programs varies considerably. They are often considered tedious and boring, and thus prematurely stopped. The primary aim of this clinical trial is to determine whether elderly persons in a rehabilitation setting show higher adherence to self-regulated training when using exergames than when performing conventional exercises. The second objective is to explore which mode of exercise leads to greater improvement in balance performance.Methods/Design: The study consists of a single blind, stratified, randomized control trial with two parallel groups. Once included, study participants will be stratified according to their balance and computer skills and randomly allocated to self-regulated training with conventional exercise programs or with exergames played with the Windows Kinect (R) sensor and FitBit (R) pedometer. In both groups, self-administered exercise programs will be taught by experienced physiotherapists and performed at the patient's own discretion during the ten days of intervention. The primary outcome is the performed daily training volume, collected by the participants in a logbook. Secondary outcomes are objective and subjective balance skills measured by an activity tracker and the Fall Efficacy Scale self-administered questionnaire. Both assessments will be performed at pre- and post-intervention.Discussion: According to the available literature, this study is the first to compare conventional self-regulated exercises with exergames among older patients in a rehabilitation setting. Results of this study will contribute to our understanding of its motivational potential on exercise adherence in elderly persons and provide more insight into the potential effectiveness of exergames promoting mobility.
[Answer]   UNCERTAIN
[Response] UNCERTAIN. Explanation: While the paper does target older people and involves an exergame intervention (using the Windows Kinect sensor and FitBit pedometer), it is a study protocol for a randomized controlled trial. The abstract indicates that the primary aim is to determine adherence to self-regulated training and explore which mode of exercise leads to greater improvement in balance performance. However, the results of the trial are not yet reported, as this is a protocol paper. Therefore, it does not fully meet the criteria for inclusion based on the requirement that the results should be reported.

[Title]    Digitally enabled aged care and neurological rehabilitation to enhance outcomes with Activity and MObility UsiNg Technology (AMOUNT) in Australia: A randomised controlled trial.
[Journal]  PLOS MEDICINE 17(2).
[Abstract] BackgroundDigitally enabled rehabilitation may lead to better outcomes but has not been tested in large pragmatic trials. We aimed to evaluate a tailored prescription of affordable digital devices in addition to usual care for people with mobility limitations admitted to aged care and neurological rehabilitation.Methods and findingsWe conducted a pragmatic, outcome-assessor-blinded, parallel-group randomised trial in 3 Australian hospitals in Sydney and Adelaide recruiting adults 18 to 101 years old with mobility limitations undertaking aged care and neurological inpatient rehabilitation. Both the intervention and control groups received usual multidisciplinary inpatient and post-hospital rehabilitation care as determined by the treating rehabilitation clinicians. In addition to usual care, the intervention group used devices to target mobility and physical activity problems, individually prescribed by a physiotherapist according to an intervention protocol, including virtual reality video games, activity monitors, and handheld computer devices for 6 months in hospital and at home. Co-primary outcomes were mobility (performance-based Short Physical Performance Battery [SPPB]; continuous version; range 0 to 3; higher score indicates better mobility) and upright time as a proxy measure of physical activity (proportion of the day upright measured with activPAL) at 6 months. The dataset was analysed using intention-to-treat principles. The trial was prospectively registered with the Australian New Zealand Clinical Trials Registry (ACTRN12614000936628). Between 22 September 2014 and 10 November 2016, 300 patients (mean age 74 years, SD 14; 50% female; 54% neurological condition causing activity limitation) were randomly assigned to intervention (n = 149) or control (n = 151) using a secure online database (REDCap) to achieve allocation concealment. Six-month assessments were completed by 258 participants (129 intervention, 129 control). Intervention participants received on average 12 (SD 11) supervised inpatient sessions using 4 (SD 1) different devices and 15 (SD 5) physiotherapy contacts supporting device use after hospital discharge. Changes in mobility scores were higher in the intervention group compared to the control group from baseline (SPPB [continuous, 0-3] mean [SD]: intervention group, 1.5 [0.7]; control group, 1.5 [0.8]) to 6 months (SPPB [continuous, 0-3] mean [SD]: intervention group, 2.3 [0.6]; control group, 2.1 [0.8]; mean between-group difference 0.2 points, 95% CI 0.1 to 0.3; p = 0.006). However, there was no evidence of a difference between groups for upright time at 6 months (mean [SD] proportion of the day spent upright at 6 months: intervention group, 18.2 [9.8]; control group, 18.4 [10.2]; mean between-group difference - 0.2, 95% CI - 2.7 to 2.3; p = 0.87). Scores were higher in the intervention group compared to the control group across most secondary mobility outcomes, but there was no evidence of a difference between groups for most other secondary outcomes including self-reported balance confidence and quality of life. No adverse events were reported in the intervention group. Thirteen participants died while in the trial (intervention group: 9; control group: 4) due to unrelated causes, and there was no evidence of a difference between groups in fall rates (unadjusted incidence rate ratio 1.19, 95% CI 0.78 to 1.83; p = 0.43). Study limitations include 15%-19% loss to follow-up at 6 months on the co-primary outcomes, as anticipated; the number of secondary outcome measures in our trial, which may increase the risk of a type I error; and potential low statistical power to demonstrate significant between-group differences on important secondary patient-reported outcomes.ConclusionsIn this study, we observed improved mobility in people with a wide range of health conditions making use of digitally enabled rehabilitation, whereas time spent upright was not impacted.
[Answer]   UNCERTAIN
[Response] UNCERTAIN. While the paper does involve older people and uses virtual reality video games as part of the intervention, it is not specifically focused on preventing falls. The primary outcomes measured are mobility (using the Short Physical Performance Battery) and upright time, and the study does not report a significant difference in fall rates between the intervention and control groups. Therefore, it is uncertain whether the paper is specifically about using exergames to prevent falls in the elderly.

[Title]    Feasibility and effects of cognitive-motor exergames on fall risk factors in typical and atypical Parkinson's inpatients: a randomized controlled pilot study.
[Journal]  EUROPEAN JOURNAL OF MEDICAL RESEARCH 28(1).
[Abstract] BackgroundPeople with Parkinson`s disease (PD) often suffer from both motor and cognitive impairments. Simultaneous motor and cognitive training stimulates neurobiological processes which are important especially for people with PD. The aim of this study is to test the feasibility and effects of simultaneous cognitive-motor training in form of exergames in the setting of inpatient rehabilitation of persons with PD.MethodsForty participants (72.4 +/- 9.54 years; Hoehn and Yahr stage 1-4) were randomly assigned to either the intervention group, which trained five times a week in addition to the conventional rehabilitation program, or the control group, which underwent the standard rehabilitation treatment only. Primary outcome was feasibility (measured by adherence rate, attrition rate, occurrence of adverse events, system usability scale (SUS), and NASA TLX score). In addition, various cognitive (Go/No-Go test, reaction time test (RTT), color word interference test (D-KEFS) and Trail Making Test A and B (TMT)) and motor (preferred gait speed, maximum gait speed, dual-task gait speed, Short Physical Performance Battery (SPPB), Timed Up and Go (TUG) and 5 times Sit-to-Stand (5xStS)) tests were conducted before and after the intervention phase in order to determine training effectsResultsAdherence rate was 97%, there were just two dropouts due to reasons unrelated to the study and there were no adverse events. The mean NASA TLX value was 56.2 and the mean value of the SUS was 76.7. Significant time-group interaction effects were observed for the 5xStS, the SPPB, the RTT, the Go/No-Go test and the D-KEFS 2.DiscussionExergaming, as applied in this study, showed to be feasible, safe and likely effective for the improvement of cognitive and motor functions of PD inpatients. Because of this future randomized controlled trials with a main focus on testing the efficacy of this new intervention are warranted.Trial registration: The study has been registered at ClinicalTrials.gov (ID: NCT04872153).

The paper describes a randomized controlled pilot study that uses exergames (cognitive-motor training) to improve cognitive and motor functions in Parkinson's disease inpatients. The intervention targets older people, and the study is a randomized controlled trial. However, the primary focus of the study is on the feasibility and effects of the exergames, rather than specifically on preventing falls. While some of the outcomes measured (e.g., gait speed, TUG, 5xStS) are related to fall risk factors, the paper does not explicitly state that the main goal is to prevent falls. Therefore, it is uncertain whether the paper is specifically about using exergames to prevent falls in the elderly.

[Title]    A Step in the Right Direction: Evaluating the Effectiveness of Customized Stepping Game Software and Balance Boards for Balance Rehabilitation Therapy and Measurement
[Journal]  2023 45TH ANNUAL INTERNATIONAL CONFERENCE OF THE IEEE ENGINEERING IN MEDICINE & BIOLOGY SOCIETY, EMBC.
[Abstract] The incidence of falls significantly increases with age in older populations. Traditionally, exercise interventions have been effective in improving balance and strength, thereby reducing the number and risk of falls. To minimize costs, to make exercise more engaging, and to reduce the burden on therapists, the use of serious gaming using virtual reality technologies has become more common. These gaming systems allow the evaluation of compensatory strategies to reduce falls. One of the easiest compensatory strategies to reduce falls is to step forward. To evaluate stepping, the time it takes to step, response times, and reaction times, a stepping game was developed using two Nintendo Wii Balance Boards (TM).The objective of this study was to investigate the stepping game system for its efficacy as a supplemental balance therapy by evaluating functional outcomes and participant satisfaction. The game was able to identify changes in performance measures (response time, reaction time and step time) for some participants over the span of the exercise program; however, a larger sample size and a stricter protocol is necessary to evaluate the clinical significance.
[Answer]   UNCERTAIN
[Response] UNCERTAIN. ### Explanation:
- Target Population: The abstract mentions "older populations," which satisfies the first criterion.
- Intervention Type: The intervention involves a stepping game using Nintendo Wii Balance Boards, which can be considered an exergame. This satisfies the second criterion.
- Study Design and Results: The study evaluates the efficacy of the stepping game as a supplemental balance therapy and reports some functional outcomes and participant satisfaction. However, it is not explicitly stated whether this was a randomized controlled trial (RCT). The abstract suggests that the sample size was small and a stricter protocol is needed to evaluate clinical significance, which implies that the results may not be robust enough to meet the criteria for a full RCT.. Given these points, it is unclear if the study meets the requirement for a randomized controlled trial, so the answer is UNCERTAIN.

[Title]    In older adults with frailty, virtual reality exercise training improves walking speed and balance.
[Journal]  ANNALS OF INTERNAL MEDICINE 176(9): JC106-JC106.
[Abstract] 
[Answer]   UNCERTAIN
[Response] Based on the information provided, we can assess the paper as follows:. - Intervention Targets: The title mentions "older adults with frailty," which satisfies the criterion that the intervention targets should include older people.
- Intervention Type: The title specifies "virtual reality exercise training," which is a form of exergame.
- Study Design: The abstract is not provided, so we cannot confirm whether the study includes randomized controlled trials and reports the results. However, the journal *Annals of Internal Medicine* typically publishes high-quality research, and the title suggests a specific outcome (improves walking speed and balance), which implies a structured study design.. Given the lack of the abstract, we cannot definitively confirm the presence of a randomized controlled trial and the reporting of results. Therefore, the answer is:. UNCERTAIN

[Title]    Feasibility randomized controlled trial of a virtual reality exergame to improve physical and cognitive functioning in older people.
[Journal]  ACTA GYMNICA 52.
[Abstract] Background: Falls risk becomes more common with age and is associated with higher rates of disability, mortality, and healthcare costs. Exergames have shown to elicit improvements in prefrontal cortex activity, balance, and postural control of seniors, all of which are associated with fall risk, but it is unknown whether virtual reality (VR) exergames, played using a three-dimensional headset can enhance the effects of cognitive and physiological functioning. Objective: Evaluation of the effects of a co-produced VR exergame "Falling diamonds" on physical performance, trunk stability and cognition, three attributes linked to falls risk in seniors. Methods: A total of 44 physically active participants aged 60-85 years were randomized to either the immersive VR exergame (n = 14), non-immersive exergame (n = 15), or control (n = 15). Static balance, leg strength, and gait speed were measured by the Short Physical Performance Battery, trunk stability was assessed using the Prone test and cognition was evaluated by the RehaCom screening software at baseline and follow-up at 9 weeks. Results: The VR exergame group experienced greater improvements in the cognition measures of selective attention control and speed (p = .009, p = .033) more than the exergame group (p = .010) and control (p = .049, p = .004). Conclusions: The evaluation and delivery methods of VR exergame Falling diamonds are feasible, and trial measures, procedures, and intervention are deemed acceptable by participants. Our findings indicate that using a VR exergame to exercise could improve cognition in seniors.
[Answer]   UNCERTAIN
[Response] UNCERTAIN. The paper does meet the criteria for (1) targeting older people, (2) using an exergame (specifically a VR exergame), and (3) being a randomized controlled trial with reported results. However, the title and abstract indicate that this is a feasibility randomized controlled trial, which suggests that the primary focus is on the feasibility of the intervention rather than the efficacy. According to the criteria, papers related to feasibility analysis without original data should not be included. Therefore, the answer is "UNCERTAIN" because it meets most of the criteria but is specifically labeled as a feasibility study.

[Title]    The design of a purpose-built exergame for fall prediction and prevention for older people.
[Journal]  EUROPEAN REVIEW OF AGING AND PHYSICAL ACTIVITY 12.
[Abstract] Background: Falls in older people represent a major age-related health challenge facing our society. Novel methods for delivery of falls prevention programs are required to increase effectiveness and adherence to these programs while containing costs. The primary aim of the Information and Communications Technology-based System to Predict and Prevent Falls (iStoppFalls) project was to develop innovative home-based technologies for continuous monitoring and exercise-based prevention of falls in community-dwelling older people. The aim of this paper is to describe the components of the iStoppFalls system.Methods: The system comprised of 1) a TV, 2) a PC, 3) the Microsoft Kinect, 4) a wearable sensor and 5) an assessment and training software as the main components.Results: The iStoppFalls system implements existing technologies to deliver a tailored home-based exercise and education program aimed at reducing fall risk in older people. A risk assessment tool was designed to identify fall risk factors. The content and progression rules of the iStoppFalls exergames were developed from evidence-based fall prevention interventions targeting muscle strength and balance in older people.Conclusions: The iStoppFalls fall prevention program, used in conjunction with the multifactorial fall risk assessment tool, aims to provide a comprehensive and individualised, yet novel fall risk assessment and prevention program that is feasible for widespread use to prevent falls and fall-related injuries. This work provides a new approach to engage older people in home-based exercise programs to complement or provide a potentially motivational alternative to traditional exercise to reduce the risk of falling.
[Answer]   UNCERTAIN
[Response] UNCERTAIN. The abstract describes the design and components of an exergame system (iStoppFalls) aimed at predicting and preventing falls in older people. However, it does not explicitly state that the paper reports the results of a randomized controlled trial. The focus appears to be on the design and description of the system rather than the outcomes of a specific intervention study. Therefore, based on the provided criteria, the answer is "UNCERTAIN."

[Title]    Effect of Virtual Reality Exercises on the Cognitive Status and Dual Motor Task Performance of the Aging Population.
[Journal]  INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL RESEARCH AND PUBLIC HEALTH 18(15).
[Abstract] Aging is a global phenomenon affecting numerous developed and developing countries. During this process, the functional state of the body, especially the cognitive state, declines. This research investigated the impact of virtual reality exercises on the cognitive status and dual-task performance in the elderly of Tabriz city, Iran. Forty men with a mean age of 71.5 were selected and assigned to either the experimental (n = 20) or control groups (n = 20). Both groups completed the Mini-Mental State Examination for cognitive status. The pre-test was performed through the Timed Up and Go test (TUG) along with a countdown of numbers. Then, the experimental group practiced virtual driving for six weeks, while the control group received no treatment. After the treatment, both groups completed the post-test. At each stage, the test was performed as a dual motor task as well. Data were analyzed using the paired t-test and the independent sample t-test to show the intra-group and inter-group differences, respectively. The results showed a significant improvement in the cognitive status and dual-task performance of the elderly men after the six-week training period, which was also significant compared to the control group. Virtual reality driving can be used to improve the cognitive status and dual task performance of elderly men.
[Answer]   UNCERTAIN
[Response] UNCERTAIN. While the paper does target older people and uses a form of exergame (virtual reality driving), it does not explicitly mention that the primary focus is on preventing falls. The outcomes measured are cognitive status and dual-task performance, which may indirectly relate to fall prevention, but this is not clearly stated. Additionally, the paper reports the results of a randomized controlled trial, which meets one of the criteria. However, since the primary focus is not on fall prevention, the answer is "UNCERTAIN."

[Title]    Three-dimensional exergaming conjunction with vestibular rehabilitation in individuals with Benign Paroxysmal Positional Vertigo: A feasibility randomized controlled study.
[Journal]  MEDICINE 103(27).
[Abstract] Background:To examine the effectiveness of 3D (dimensional)-vestibular rehabilitation therapy (VRT) on gait, balance problems, processing time speed and subjective complaints in patients with Benign Paroxysmal Positional Vertigo (BPPV) compared to a control group (CG). This study aimed to test the feasibility of virtual reality-based 3D exergaming conjunction with vestibular rehabilitation.Methods:Twenty-two patients with BPPV (negative DixHallpike/Roll test results, existing dizziness/balance complaints) were randomly allocated to the study group (SG, n:11 3D-VRT) or Control group (CG n:11, no exercise-rehabilitation) for 8 week. The SG performed 3D-VRT for 45 to 50 min/d, 3 times/wk, and the CG did receive only Canalith Repositioning Maneuver (CRM). CRM was applied in both groups before the study. Outcome measures included 10-Meter-Walk-Test (10-MWT) (with/without head turns), Dynamic Gait Index (DGI), Choice-Stepping-Reaction-Time-ped (CSRT-MAT), Fullerton Advanced Balance Scale (FAB), and Visual Analog Scale (VAS).Results:The SG showed significantly improvement in 10-MWT without (p5 = 0.00,eta 2 = 0.49), with horizontal (p5 = 0.00,eta 2 = 0.57),vertical (p5 = 0.01,eta 2 = 0.48) head turns, DGI (p5 = 0.00,eta 2 = 0.74), CSRT-MAT, FAB (p5 = 0.00,eta 2 = 0.78) and VAS-dizziness (p5 = 0.00,eta 2 = 0.65), VAS-balance problem (p5 = 0.00,eta 2 = 0.43), VAS-fear of falling (p5 = 0.00,eta 2 = 0.42) compared to the CG.Conclusion:The 3D-VRT were effective in improving gait, balance, processing speed and resolving the subjective complaints in BPPV. The 3D-VRT method is feasible for patients who suffer from residual dizziness or balance complaints after CRM. Furthermore, the 3D-VRT is more accessible and less expensive than other virtual reality applications, which may facilitate further research or clinical use.
[Answer]   UNCERTAIN
[Response] UNCERTAIN. The paper does involve an exergame (3D-VRT) and a randomized controlled trial, and it reports the results. However, the target population is individuals with Benign Paroxysmal Positional Vertigo (BPPV), not specifically older people. The study's primary focus is on the feasibility of the intervention for BPPV patients, and while it includes measures related to balance and fear of falling, it is not explicitly about preventing falls in the elderly. Therefore, based on the given criteria, the answer is UNCERTAIN.

[Title]    Evaluation of a Rehabilitation System for the Elderly in a Day Care Center.
[Journal]  INFORMATION 10(1).
[Abstract] This paper presents a rehabilitation system based on a customizable exergame protocol to prevent falls in the elderly population. The system is based on depth sensors and exergames. The experiments carried out with several seniors, in a day care center, make it possible to evaluate the usability and the efficiency of the system. The outcomes highlight the user-friendliness, the very good usability of the developed system and the significant enhancement of the elderly in maintaining a physical activity. The performance of the postural response is improved by an average of 80%.
[Answer]   UNCERTAIN
[Response] UNCERTAIN. While the paper does target older people and uses an exergame intervention, it is not clear from the abstract whether the study includes a randomized controlled trial. The abstract mentions experiments and evaluations but does not explicitly state that a randomized controlled trial was conducted. Therefore, based on the given criteria, the answer is "UNCERTAIN."

[Title]    Treatment Resort Extended with Modern Feedback Exercises Using Virtual Reality to Improve Postural Control in Patients Aged 65+ with an Increased Risk of Falls. Preliminary Study.
[Journal]  ACTA BALNEOLOGICA 61(3): 163-170.
[Abstract] Introduction: The aim of the study was to learn the influence of treatment resort extended with modern exercises with feedback using virtual reality for postural control and reducing the risk of falls in people aged 65+.Material and Methods: Seventy four people (46 women, 28 men; aged 65-84) participated for three weeks in spa therapy, which was extended with physical exercises using feedback based on virtual reality to improve postural control and reduce the risk of falls. Postural control tests, "get up and go" test (TUG) and test standing up from the chair for 30 seconds were performed to assess the progress of the therapy.Results: After treatment in the Romberg trial performed on the stabilometric platform with open and closed eyes, a statistically significant improvement in most parameters indicating improved postural control was noted, including reduction of path length and surface area of center of foot pressure (COP), reduction of the length and speed of bowel movements COP in the frontal and sagittal planes. A statistically significant reduction in the time of the TUG test and increase the number of repetitions of standing up from the chair in 30 seconds were also noted. Statistical significance was assumed at the level of p <= 0.05.Conclusions: Treatment resort enriched with exercises using virtual reality and feedback contributes to improving postural control and reducing the risk of falls in people aged 65+. The results of the study should be confirmed in high-quality therapeutic experiments, including control groups.
[Answer]   UNCERTAIN
[Response] UNCERTAIN. The paper involves older people (aged 65+) and uses an intervention that includes virtual reality, which can be considered an exergame. However, the study is described as a preliminary study, and it does not explicitly mention a randomized controlled trial (RCT). The results are reported, but the lack of a control group and the description of the study as "preliminary" suggest that it may not meet the criteria for a full RCT. Therefore, based on the given criteria, the answer is "UNCERTAIN."

[Title]    Combining Exergame Training with Omega-3 Fatty Acid Supplementation: Protocol for a Randomized Controlled Study Assessing the Effect on Neuronal Structure/Function in the Elderly Brain.
[Journal]  FRONTIERS IN AGING NEUROSCIENCE 8.
[Abstract] A common problem in the older population is the risk of falling and related injury, immobility, and reduced survival. Age-related neuronal changes, e.g., decline in gray-and white-matter, affect neuronal, cognitive, and motor functioning. The improvement of these factors might decrease fall events in elderly. Studies showed that administration of video game-based physical exercise, a so-called exergame, or omega-3 fatty acid (FA) may improve motor and/or cognitive functioning through neuronal changes in the brain of older adults. The aim of this study is to assess the effects of a combination of exergame training with omega-3 FA supplementation on the elderly brain. We hypothesize that an intervention using a combination approach differently affects on the neuronal structure and function of the elderly's brain as compared to the sole administration of exergame training. The study is a parallel, double-blinded, randomized controlled trial lasting 26 weeks. Sixty autonomous living, non-smoking, and right-handed healthy older (>65 years) adults who live independently or in a senior residency are included, randomized, and allocated to one of two study groups. The experimental group receives a daily amount of 13.5 ml fish oil (including 2.9g of omega-3 FA), whereas the control group receives a daily amount of 13.5 ml olive oil for 26 weeks. After 16 weeks, both groups start with an exergame training program three times per week. Measurements are performed on three time-points by treatment blinded investigators: pre-intervention measurements, blood sample after 16 week, and post-intervention measurements. The main outcomes are motor evoked potentials of the right M. tibialis anterior (transcranial magnetic stimulation) and response-related potentials (electroencephalography) during a cognitive test. For secondary outcomes, reaction time during cognitive tests and spatio-temporal parameters during gait performance are measured. Statistics will include effect sizes and a 2 x 2-ANOVA with normally distributed data or the non-parametric equivalent for data not fulfilling normal distribution. The randomized controlled study is the first to investigate the effectiveness of exergame training combined with omega-3 FA in counteracting age-and behavioral-dependent neuronal changes in the brain. This study has been registered in the Swiss National Clinical Trials (SNCTP000001623) and the ISRCTN (ISRCTN12084831) Portals.
[Answer]   UNCERTAIN
[Response] UNCERTAIN. The paper describes a randomized controlled trial that includes exergame training as part of the intervention for elderly participants. However, the primary focus is on the combination of exergame training with omega-3 fatty acid supplementation and its effects on neuronal structure and function in the elderly brain. The abstract does not explicitly state that the study aims to prevent falls, although it mentions that improving motor and cognitive functioning might decrease fall events. Therefore, while the study involves exergames and targets older people, it is not clear if the primary aim is to prevent falls, making the answer "UNCERTAIN."

[Title]    Effects of exergame training combined with omega-3 fatty acids on the elderly brain: a randomized double-blind placebo-controlled trial.
[Journal]  BMC GERIATRICS 19.
[Abstract] BackgroundOlder adults often suffer from age- and behavior-related brain changes affecting neuronal functioning and, therefore, cognitive and motor functions. The improvement of these functions might decrease falls and improve mobility. Previous studies indicate that video game-based physical exercise, so-called exergames, or omega-3 fatty acids (FAs) improve motor and cognitive functioning through brain adaptations. The aim of this study was to assess the effects of exergame training combined with fish oil supplementation on neuronal system levels in the brain and behavioral measurements in older adults. We hypothesized that the combination would differently affect these factors compared to the sole administration of exergame.MethodsFifty-eight participants were randomly assigned to one of two groups (N=29 each group) in a parallel, double-blind, randomized controlled trial lasting 26weeks. The experimental group received daily fish oil, whereas the control group received daily olive oil. After 16weeks, both groups started with an exergame training. Measurements were performed pre, during, and post intervention. Primary outcomes were recruitment curves using transcranial magnetic stimulation and response-locked potentials using electroencephalography. Secondary outcomes included executive functions and gait parameters. Blood samples were taken to control for FAs.ResultsForty-three individuals (mean age 69.44.6years) completed the study (N-experimental=22, N-control=21). The results showed no significant time x group interaction effects for any parameters. Blood samples demonstrated significant time x group interaction effects. Post-hoc tests showed a significant increase of omega-3 FAs (p<.001) and a significant decrease of omega-6 FAs (p<.001) for the experimental group.ConclusionThe combination of exergame training and fish oil did not lead to additional beneficial effects. To trigger possible effects, future studies should carefully consider study design aspects; e.g. study duration, individual nutritional supplementation dose, omega-3 FAs supplementation composition, and placebo. Furthermore, studies should consider neuroimaging methods as these might be more sensitive to assess early brain adaptations. Thus, future studies should be aware of several aspects running a combinatory study that includes omega-3 FAs according to their expected effects.Trial registration p id=Par5 Swiss National Clinical Trials SNCTP000001623 and ISRCTN12084831 registered 30 November 2015.
[Answer]   UNCERTAIN
[Response] UNCERTAIN. While the paper does involve older adults and includes exergame training as part of the intervention, the primary focus is on the combination of exergame training with omega-3 fatty acids. The study aims to assess the effects of this combination on neuronal system levels and behavioral measurements, rather than specifically focusing on fall prevention. Additionally, the results reported do not show significant effects related to the exergame intervention alone or in combination with omega-3 fatty acids on the parameters measured. Therefore, it is uncertain whether the paper meets the specific criteria for being about the use of exergames to prevent falls in the elderly.

[Title]    Development of an Exergame for Urban-dwelling Older Adults With Functional Limitations: Results and Lessons Learned.
[Journal]  PROGRESS IN COMMUNITY HEALTH PARTNERSHIPS-RESEARCH EDUCATION AND ACTION 10(1): 73-81.
[Abstract] Background: Falls at home are common and potentially fatal for disabled older adults. To address this problem, we created an academic-community partnership involving disabled, urban-dwelling older adults and their families, the housing authority, a Tai Chi master, and a university.Objectives: We conducted a pilot to assess safety, acceptability, and feasibility of a Wii-based exergame designed to increase disabled older adults' strength and balance.Methods: A working prototype was developed and evaluated. Then, we piloted a refined version with 19 disabled urban dwelling older adults.Results: The program was enjoyable, feasible, and acceptable. Participants described multiple functional improvements. Of the 16 who completed at least three gaming sessions, average balance score increased 25% and gait speed increased 19%.Conclusions: This pilot showed promising results for improving strength and balance in the home setting, and yielded valuable lessons about health technology development with community partners.
[Answer]   UNCERTAIN
[Response] UNCERTAIN. Explanation:
- The intervention targets older adults, which meets the first criterion.
- The intervention is an exergame (Wii-based), which meets the second criterion.
- The paper reports results from a pilot study, but it does not explicitly state that the study was a randomized controlled trial. Therefore, it is uncertain whether the third criterion is met.. Since the paper does not clearly indicate that it includes a randomized controlled trial, the answer is "UNCERTAIN."

[Title]    Evaluation of autonomic cardiac modulation and body composition in elderly submitted to the protocol of exercise and the gametherapy: A clinical trial protocol (SPIRIT compliant).
[Journal]  MEDICINE 101(47).
[Abstract] Introduction:Aging affects the cardiovascular system by impairing the amount and strength of cardiac pumping. Heart rate variability (HRV) is a safe parameter to assess variations in the cardiovascular system, providing data on sympathetic and parasympathetic activations. Objectives:Our primary aim is to investigate the cardiac autonomic modulation and body composition of active older adults participating in a physical exercise protocol and gametherapy. Our secondary aim is to assess their functional capacity, cognitive function, balance, respiratory pressures, and functional autonomy. Method:This randomized clinical trial will include 100 active older adults aged 60 to 80 years. The exercise group (EG) will perform 24 supervised training sessions (strength and aerobic) for 12 weeks (2 60-minutes sessions per week). The gametherapy group (GG) will exercise using gametherapy. Assessments will occur on the first week, after the 12th week, after wash out and in the end of cross over. The primary outcome will be HRV and body composition (bioimpedance). Secondary outcomes will be functional capacity (6-minute walk test), cognitive function (mini-mental state examination), risk of falls and balance (berg balance scale and timed up and go test), inspiratory and expiratory pressures (manovacuometry) and functional autonomy (functional reach test and group of Latin American development to maturity [GDLAM] protocol). Discussion:This study will provide relevant information about the effects of physical training (physical exercises and gametherapy) on HRV and other variables in active older adults.
[Answer]   UNCERTAIN
[Response] UNCERTAIN. Explanation: The abstract mentions a "gametherapy group (GG)" which could potentially involve exergames, but it does not explicitly state that the gametherapy is an exergame. Additionally, the primary and secondary outcomes do not specifically focus on fall prevention, although they do include balance and risk of falls as part of the secondary outcomes. Therefore, based on the given criteria, it is uncertain whether the paper is specifically about the use of exergames to prevent falls in the elderly.

[Title]    Analysis of effects and usage indicators for a ICT-based fall prevention system in community dwelling older adults.
[Journal]  INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF HUMAN-COMPUTER STUDIES 106: 10-25.
[Abstract] Falls are a serious problem in aging societies. A sedentary life style and low levels of physical activity are major factors aggravating older adults' fall risk. Information and communication technology (ICT)-based fall prevention interventions are a promising approach to counteract the fall risk of this target group. For some time now, fall prevention interventions have put emphasize to video game based solutions, as video games have become more popular and accepted among older adults. Studies show that such ICT-based fall prevention interventions significantly reduce fall risk in older adults. Nevertheless, the population of older adults is fairly heterogeneous, and factors like gender, age, fitness, sociability, and so on may influence the use of such systems. Therefore, the analysis of subgroups is a common procedure to investigate the affects of various factors on the effectiveness of ICT-based systems. Many of these studies analyze the effectiveness of the system with quantitative measures only. However, the effectiveness of ICT-based fall prevention systems always depends on the sustainable system use by the target group. Qualitative analyses is generally the prime selection to identify determining usage indicators for system usage. Therefore, it seems likely that combined quantitative and qualitative investigations will generate detailed information about system effectiveness and relevant usage indicators for respective target groups. Here, we analyze the ICT-based fall prevention system, iStoppFalls, incorporating exergames and a mobility monitor as well, targeting three aims, (1) is the system effective for different subgroups of older adults, (2) what are the factors influencing fall risk reduction in older adults using the system and are there combined effects of exergaming and activity monitoring on fall risk reduction, and (3) which usage indicators explain the usage of such a system by older adults. This paper will provide a better understanding of the effectiveness of ICT-based fall prevention for different subgroups and the indicators that determine the use of such technologies by older adults.

[Answer]   UNCERTAIN
[Response] UNCERTAIN. The abstract discusses an ICT-based fall prevention system that incorporates exergames and a mobility monitor. It mentions the use of exergames as part of the intervention, which targets older adults. However, it is not explicitly clear from the abstract whether the study includes randomized controlled trials (RCTs) and reports the results. The focus seems to be on analyzing the effectiveness of the system for different subgroups and identifying usage indicators, but the specific methodology (e.g., RCT) is not mentioned. Therefore, based on the given criteria, the answer is "UNCERTAIN."

[Title]    Feasibility, safety, acceptability, and functional outcomes of playing Nintendo Wii Fit Plus™ for frail older adults: A randomized feasibility clinical trial.
[Journal]  MATURITAS 118: 20-28.
[Abstract] Background: Recently, interactive video games (IVGs) have been used as a health-care intervention that provides both exercise and cognitive stimulation. Several studies have shown that IVGs can improve postural control, gait, cognition, and functional independence in elderly people and patients with neurological disease. However, there is a lack of evidence about the effects of IVGs on frail and pre-frail elderly people. The aim of this study was to evaluate the feasibility, safety, and acceptability of playing Nintendo Wii Fit Plus (TM) (NWFP) interactive video games, and the functional outcomes (postural control, gait, cognition, mood, and fear of falling) in frail and pre-frail older adults.Methods: This study is a randomized controlled, parallel-group, feasibility trial. Participants were frail and pre-frail older adults randomly assigned to the experimental group (EG, n = 15) or control group (CG, n = 15). Participants in the EG performed 14 training sessions, lasting 50 min each, twice a week. In each training session, participants played five of 10 selected games, with two attempts at each game. Participants in the CG received general advice regarding the importance of physical activity. All participants were assessed on three occasions by a blinded physical therapist: before and after intervention, and 30 days after the end of the intervention (follow-up). We assessed the feasibility (score of participants in the games), acceptability (game satisfaction questionnaire), safety (adverse events during training sessions), and functional outcomes: (1) postural control (Mini-BESTest); (2) gait (Functional Gait Assessment); (3) cognition (Montreal Cognitive Assessment); (4) mood (GDS-15); and (5) fear of falling (FES-I).Results: Participants in the EG improved their scores in all 10 games, reported that they understood and enjoyed the tasks of the games, and presented few adverse events during the practice. There was a significant improvement in the Mini-BESTest and Functional Gait Assessment in the EG when compared with the CG (p < 0.05).Conclusion: The use of NWFP was feasible, acceptable, and safe for frail older adults and improved their postural control and gait. There were no effects on cognition, mood, or fear of falling.This trial was registered in the Brazilian Registry of Clinical Trials (RBR-823rst) on 11 June 2016.
[Answer]   UNCERTAIN
[Response] UNCERTAIN. While the paper does target older people and uses an exergame (Nintendo Wii Fit Plus™) as the intervention, it is specifically a feasibility trial. The criteria for judgment specify that papers related to feasibility analysis without original data should not be included. Although the study reports some functional outcomes, the primary focus is on the feasibility, safety, and acceptability of the intervention, rather than a full randomized controlled trial with a primary focus on preventing falls. Therefore, the answer is "UNCERTAIN."

[Title]    Time course of changes in motor-cognitive exergame performances during task-specific training in patients with dementia: identification and predictors of early training response.
[Journal]  JOURNAL OF NEUROENGINEERING AND REHABILITATION 15.
[Abstract] BackgroundSome studies have already suggested that exergame interventions can be effective to improve physical, cognitive, motor-cognitive, and psychological outcomes in patients with dementia (PwD). However, little is known about the training volume required to induce such positive effects and the inter-individual differences in training response among PwD. The aim of the study was to analyze the time course of changes in motor-cognitive exergame performances during a task-specific training program and to identify predictors of early training response in PwD.MethodsSecondary analyses of data from the intervention group (IG) of a randomized, placebo-controlled trial to improve motor-cognitive performances in PwD. Fifty-six geriatric patients with mild-to-moderate dementia randomized to the IG underwent a 10-week, task-specific training program (2x/week) on an exergame-based balance training system (Physiomat (R)), combining postural control tasks with cognitive tasks of an established neuropsychological test (Trail Making Test). Main outcome was the time required to complete different Physiomat (R)-Tasks (PTs) assessed at baseline (T1), training session 7 (TS7) and 14 (TS14), and post-intervention after 20 training sessions (T2). Reliable change indices were used to identify early responders from T1 to TS7. A multivariate logistic regression analysis was performed to determine independent predictors of early training response.ResultsCompletion time significantly improved already from T1 to TS7 in all PTs (p.001-.006), with moderate to very large effect sizes (r=.38-.52; Cohen's d=.85-1.45). For most PTs, significant progressive improvements from TS7 to TS14 and TS14 to T2 were not observed. Thirty-one (59.6%) participants were classified as early responders and 21 (40.4%) as non-early responders. Lower baseline exergame performance and lower visuospatial and divided attention abilities were independently associated with early training response.ConclusionsSubstantial task-specific improvements in complex motor-cognitive exergame performances can be obtained within a surprisingly short intervention period in PwD. Our results confirm that not only an excellent training response can be achieved in this patient population, but also that more vulnerable patients with greater deficits in domain-specific cognitive functions associated with fall risk may even reap the most and fastest benefit from motor-cognitive exergame interventions.Trial registrationISRCTN registry, ISRCTN37232817 (retrospectively registered on 04/02/2012).
[Answer]   UNCERTAIN
[Response] UNCERTAIN. ### Explanation:
- Target Population: The study includes older people, specifically patients with dementia (PwD), which meets the first criterion.
- Intervention: The intervention is an exergame, combining postural control tasks with cognitive tasks, which meets the second criterion.
- Study Design and Results: The paper reports on a randomized, placebo-controlled trial, and the results are reported, which meets the third criterion.
- Type of Paper: The abstract suggests that this is a secondary analysis of data from a randomized controlled trial. While it provides detailed results, it is not entirely clear if this is a standalone RCT or part of a larger study. Additionally, the focus is more on the time course of changes and predictors of early training response rather than a primary outcome related to fall prevention.. Given these points, the paper is very close to meeting all the criteria, but the specific focus on fall prevention is not explicitly mentioned, and the type of analysis (secondary) introduces some uncertainty. Therefore, the answer is "UNCERTAIN."
