[Title]    Supporting people with dementia and their caregivers' everyday occupations through home hazard identification and virtual reality-based training.
[Journal]  ALZHEIMERS & DEMENTIA 16.
[Abstract] Background: Falls are a common health hazard among older people and have become a major cause of disability. The risk of falling increases with age and many older people need extended hospital stays as a result of a fall, and some may be admitted to residential care after a fall. The interaction between the older adults with dementia, their living environment and fall is an area of concern from occupational therapy.Method: This is a pioneer study composed of a home falls and accident screening and with two types of intervention in a 12-month longitudinal randomized controlled trial. In the first month, participants received the psychoeducation program on home safety and fall prevention in their own home. Then for the following eleven months, participants were randomized to either control group which participants will receive biweekly reviews of home safety and fall prevention. Experimental group will have regular training on the use of VR-based home safety alertness for near miss.Result: 100 community dwelling moderate dementia subjects (CDR> 2) were recruited, 25 of them reported with five or more home hazards and labelled as high risk group. 32% of subjects reported with hazards which labelled as "Home Environment and Furniture", 28% of recruited population reported with hazards in "Capability in Activities of Daily Living" and 32 % reported with hazards in "Use of devices". In one-year follow-up, both experimental group showed significantly lower incidence of fall of 5 % when compared with 18% in general dementia population.Conclusion: Results indicated home safety and fall prevention screening is effective to reduce home hazards. Application of VR can be a reinforcing strategy for people with dementia and can help alleviate stress of caregivers.

[Title]    C-Mill Virtual Reality/Augmented Reality Treadmill Training for Reducing Risk of Fall in the Elderly: A Randomized Controlled Trial.
[Journal]  GAMES FOR HEALTH JOURNAL 13(4): 258-267.
[Abstract] Objective: Falling is considered one of the major problems that may affect the elderly, leading to multiple health issues. Walking adaptability to environmental demands is essential for safe walking in the elderly. The aim of this study was to evaluate the efficacy of virtual reality (VR)/augmented reality (AR) treadmill training on balance performance and the risk of falls in the elderly.Materials and Methods: Sixty Saudi elderly individuals of both genders, aged between 60 and 70 years, participated in the study. The participants were categorized into two groups: the experimental and the control groups. Both groups received 1 hour of training: 30 minutes of conventional exercises and 30 minutes of gait training on the C-Mill VR/AR treadmill. The experimental group used the C-Mill treadmill with VR and AR games therapy. The control group had gait training on the C-Mill treadmill without VR and AR. The training for both groups was conducted for 6 successive weeks/three times a week. The changes in the scores of the following variables were recorded at baseline, after 6 weeks of training, and 4 weeks after the completion of training. These variables involved the time needed for completing the Timed Up and Go (TUG) test, overall stability indices of the Fall Risk (FR) test and Limit of Stability (LOS) test evaluated using the Biodex Balance System (BBS), and the time required for completing the LOS test.Results: Both groups demonstrated significant improvement in all measured variables immediately post-training, and this improvement persisted for 4 weeks after completing the training. The experimental group exhibited greater improvement in the recorded values of all measured variables compared with the control group following the training.Conclusions: This study concluded that C-Mill VR/AR treadmill training is effective in improving balance control and reducing the fall risk in the elderly.

[Title]    Motion tracking virtual reality technology in improving gait in the elderly: A randomized controlled trial.
[Journal]  CLINICAL REHABILITATION 38(4): 520-529.
[Abstract] Objective This study aimed to assess the effectiveness of virtual reality-based treadmill training on gait performance and tolerance in the elderly.Design Two-armed randomized controlled trial.Setting The Medical Rehabilitation Sciences Department, Umm Al Qura University, Saudi Arabia.Participants Sixty Saudi elderly of both sexes, aged 65-75 years, were included.Interventions Participants were divided into two groups. The control group received treadmill training without virtual reality, alongside a conventional exercise program. The experimental group received a training program that was similar to the control group's exercises but with C-Mill virtual reality treadmill training. The program lasted one hour, three times per week, over four consecutive weeks.Main Measures The study assessed changes in outcome measures at baseline, Post-1 (after four weeks of training), and Post-2 (four weeks post-training). These measures encompassed the primary outcome, the 6-minute walk test (meter), as well as secondary outcomes such as stride length (meter), stride time (second), cadence (steps/minute), and velocity (meter/second). These parameters were evaluated using the GaitRite electronic gait analysis walkway.Results The experimental group showed better improvement in the mean values of the 6-minute walk test, stride length, stride time, cadence, and velocity compared to the control group at post-1 and post-2. The P-values were respectively at post-1 (0.019, 0.015, 0.041, 0.013, and 0.021) and (0.011, 0.025, 0.073, 0.061, and 0.017) at post-2 (all, P < .05).Conclusions C-Mill virtual reality treadmill training shows potential in improving gait parameters and walking tolerance in the elderly in Saudi Arabia.

[Title]    Application of Interactive Video Games as Rehabilitation Tools to Improve Postural Control and Risk of Falls in Prefrail Older Adults.
[Journal]  CYBORG AND BIONIC SYSTEMS 2021.
[Abstract] The purpose of this study was to examine whether interactive video game (IVG) training is an effective way to improve postural control outcomes and decrease the risk of falls. A convenience sample of 12 prefrail older adults were recruited and divided into two groups: intervention group performed IVG training for 40 minutes, twice per week, for a total of 16 sessions. The control group received no intervention and continued their usual activity. Outcome measures were centre of pressure (COP), mean velocity, sway area, and sway path. Secondary outcomes were Berg Balance Scale, Timed Up and Go (TUG), Falls Efficacy Scale International (FES-I), and Activities-Specific Balance Confidence (ABC). Assessment was conducted with preintervention (week zero) and postintervention (week eight). The intervention group showed significant improvement in mean velocity, sway area, Berg Balance Scale, and TUG (p < 0.01) compared to the control group. However, no significant improvement was observed for sway path (p = 0.35), FES-I (p = 0.383), and ABC (p = 0.283). This study showed that IVG training led to significant improvements in postural control but not for risk of falls.

[Title]    Integrated cognitive and physical fitness training enhances attention abilities in older adults.
[Journal]  NPJ AGING 8(1).
[Abstract] Preserving attention abilities is of great concern to older adults who are motivated to maintain their quality of life. Both cognitive and physical fitness interventions have been utilized in intervention studies to assess maintenance and enhancement of attention abilities in seniors, and a coupling of these approaches is a compelling strategy to buttress both cognitive and physical health in a time- and resource-effective manner. With this perspective, we created a closed-loop, motion-capture video game (Body-Brain Trainer: BBT) that adapts a player's cognitive and physical demands in an integrated approach, thus creating a personalized and cohesive experience across both domains. Older adults who engaged in two months of BBT improved on both physical fitness (measures of blood pressure and balance) and attention (behavioral and neural metrics of attention on a continuous performance task) outcome measures beyond that of an expectancy matched, active, placebo control group, with maintenance of improved attention performance evidenced 1 year later. Following training, the BBT group's improvement on the attention outcome measure exceeded performance levels attained by an untrained group of 20-year olds, and showed age-equilibration of a neural signature of attention shown to decline with age: midline frontal theta power. These findings highlight the potential benefits of an integrated, cognitive-physical, closed-loop training platform as a powerful tool for both cognitive and physical enhancement in older adults.
[Answer]   YES
[Response] YES. The paper meets the criteria for being about the use of exergames to prevent falls in the elderly:
1. The intervention targets older adults.
2. The intervention is an exergame, specifically a closed-loop, motion-capture video game (Body-Brain Trainer: BBT) that integrates cognitive and physical training.
3. The study includes a randomized controlled trial, with results reported on both physical fitness (including balance) and attention outcomes.
4. The paper presents original data from the trial, rather than a meta-analysis, review, or feasibility analysis.

[Title]    Trunk motion visual feedback during walking improves dynamic balance in older adults: Assessor blinded randomized controlled trial.
[Journal]  GAIT & POSTURE 62: 342-348.
[Abstract] Background: Virtual reality and augmented feedback have become more prevalent as training methods to improve balance. Few reports exist on the benefits of providing trunk motion visual feedback (VFB) during treadmill walking, and most of those reports only describe within session changes.Research question: To determine whether trunk motion VFB treadmill walking would improve over-ground balance for older adults with self-reported balance problems.Methods: 40 adults (75.8 years (SD 6.5)) with self-reported balance difficulties or a history of falling were randomized to a control or experimental group. Everyone walked on a treadmill at a comfortable speed 3x/week for 4 weeks in 2 min bouts separated by a seated rest. The control group was instructed to look at a stationary bulls-eye target while the experimental group also saw a moving cursor superimposed on the stationary bulls-eye that represented VFB of their walking trunk motion. The experimental group was instructed to keep the cursor in the center of the bulls-eye. Somatosensory (monofilaments and joint position testing) and vestibular function (canal specific clinical head impulses) was evaluated prior to intervention. Balance and mobility were tested before and after the intervention using Berg Balance Test, BESTest, mini-BESTest, and Six Minute Walk.Results: There were no significant differences between groups before the intervention. The experimental group significantly improved on the BESTest (p = 0.031) and the mini-BEST (p = 0.019). The control group did not improve significantly on any measure. Individuals with more profound sensory impairments had a larger improvement on dynamic balance subtests of the BESTest.Significance: Older adults with self-reported balance problems improve their dynamic balance after training using trunk motion VFB treadmill walking. Individuals with worse sensory function may benefit more from trunk motion VFB during walking than individuals with intact sensory function.

[Response] YES. The paper meets the criteria for being about the use of exergames to prevent falls in the elderly:
1. The intervention targets older adults (mean age 75.8 years) with self-reported balance difficulties or a history of falling.
2. The intervention involves trunk motion visual feedback (VFB) during treadmill walking, which can be considered a form of exergame as it uses virtual reality and augmented feedback.
3. The study is a randomized controlled trial, and the results are reported.
4. The paper presents original data from the trial, not a meta-analysis, review, or feasibility analysis.

[Title]    Virtual Reality Training Affects Center of Pressure (COP)-Based Balance Parameters in Older Individuals.
[Journal]  APPLIED SCIENCES-BASEL 14(16).
[Abstract] Postural imbalance is a leading cause of injury in older adults. Our study investigated the effectiveness of virtual reality (VR)-based interventions on balance ability in this population. Here, we examined 21 older, healthy adults (75.8 +/- 5.2 years old). Participants performed 6 weeks of balance training, twice per week for 30 min; the experimental group donned an Oculus VR headset during the training while control participants did not. To assess balance ability, a force platform measured displacement of the center of pressure (COP) during quiet standing in double-leg, tandem, and single-leg stances with eyes closed pre- and post-assessment. COP measurements included mediolateral (ML) and anterior-posterior (AP) directions for root mean square (RMS), peak-to-peak displacement (MAXD), total excursion (TE), and 95% confidence area ellipse (AE) parameters. Post-training assessments showed improvements (significant decreases) in the COP parameters. Control group COP parameters improved in various stances ranging from a 3% to 40% decrease on average. The VR group improved MAXD, TE, and 95% AE ranging from a 5% to 47% decrease, on average, across various stances post- compared to pre-training. VR-based exercise training programs may encourage older adults to engage in mobility exercises, leading to a reduced risk of falls or injuries.

[Title]    Effects of virtual reality versus conventional balance training on balance of the elderly.
[Journal]  EXPERIMENTAL GERONTOLOGY 153.
[Abstract] Objective: The aging population is growing in the world, and the reduction in physical function caused by this is an important issue that, particularly, causes a disorder of balance and an increased risk of falling. This study aimed at the comparison between the effects of virtual reality training (VRT) and Conventional balance training (CBT) on the balance of the elderly. Methods: The present study was conducted on 36 elderly (men and women) who are living in nursing homes. Participants were randomly divided into three groups: virtual reality training (6 males, 6 females; age = 66.5 +/- 3.8 years), Conventional balance training (6 males, 6 females; age = 67.5 +/- 3.1 years), and control (5 males, 7 females; age = 66.7 +/- 3.2 years). Each group participated in a 60-min session, 3 times per week, for 9 weeks. To assess the participants' balance, the balance tests were used on single-leg stance (SLS) with open and closed eyes, Functional reach test (FRT), Timed up and Go Test (TUG), and Fullerton Advance Balance Scale (FABS). Data analysis was done using paired t-test and analysis of covariance by SPSS software version 24 at the significant level (P = 0.05). Results: In both groups (VRT, CBT), SLS with open and closed eyes, FRT, TUG, and FABS were significantly improved (P<0.05). After the intervention, changes in both groups were similar (P > 0.05), which indicates that neither VRT and CBT training methods were superior to the other. Conclusion: According to the results of this study, it seems that a virtual reality training program can be used as a new training method to improve the elderly's balance in daily programs of nursing homes.

[Title]    Balance training monitoring and individual response during unstable vs. stable balance Exergaming in elderly adults: Findings from a randomized controlled trial.
[Journal]  EXPERIMENTAL GERONTOLOGY 139.
[Abstract] Objective: Exercise-based fall prevention programs mainly refer to multimodal and challenging balance exercises. Individual load monitoring and interpretations are crucial to enable adequate adaptation responses on the individual level. Thus, assessing internal responses to external stimuli throughout an intervention period need to be adequately addressed. The aim of this secondary analysis of a 3-armed randomized controlled trial was to analyze internal and external loads of unstable vs. stable balance Exergame training in healthy seniors. We intended to elucidate whether differences of external and internal load criteria occur over the intervention period.Methods: A total of 51 healthy seniors (females: n = 34; males: n = 17; age: 69 +/- 6 years; BMI: 27 +/- 5) were allocated to either volitional stepping (VOL), volitional stepping under unstable conditions (VOL + US) or an inactive control group (CON). VOL and VOL + US completed 8 weeks of Exergame based step training (three weekly sessions, 45 min each) using the Dividat Senso device. Twelve different balance Exergames were used, consisting of virtual reality like video games. The original nonswinging, stable platform was employed for VOL, whereas VOL + US used an adapted Senso mounted on a swinging Posturomed Rack. The instability level was increased for VOL + US only every second week. External (game scores) and internal (perceived efforts, using the rated perceived exertion scale (RPE)) load measures were individually recorded for every session. Statistical analysis was carried out using linear mixed-effects modelling.Results: Although VOL + US completed similar games at identical training volumes under unstable conditions, the achieved game scores did not significantly differ between both training groups (p = 0.71). Both intervention groups notably improved their game scores over the 8 training weeks (p < 0.01). A significant time x group interaction effect was observed for perceived effort (p < 0.01), serving as an internal load measure. Subsequent post-hoc testing revealed significant greater perceived exertion values in each of the first 7 weeks (p < 0.05) in VOL + US compared to VOL. No between-group differences were found for RPE in week 8. Whereas RPE values in VOL + US decreased over time (week 1: 4.6 +/- 1.9; week 8: 3.1 +/- 1.6), VOL indicated similar RPE values for all weeks (week 1: 3.1 +/- 1.3; week 8: 2.9 +/- 1.4). A detailed analysis of all twelve games revealed that differences in perceived exertion depend on the game content: in 75% of the involved games the RPE level was significantly higher in VOL + US compared to VOL (p < 0.05).Conclusion: Monitoring internal and external loads on individual level are paramount for gaining adequate training adaptations. Our results indicate that between-group differences in perceived efforts a) can funnel over time, b) depend on game content and c) do not necessarily affect overall scoring. Future studies should individually employ and monitor measures of perceived efforts to guarantee an adequate challenge to the balance system within exercise-based fall prevention programs.

[Title]    Single or Multiplayer Mode? Examining the Effects of Exergames in Improving Physical Health and Well-Being Among Older Adults.
[Journal]  GAMES FOR HEALTH JOURNAL.
[Abstract] Objective: This study assesses the impact of single-player and multiplayer exergaming modes on improving exercise intentions, reduction of fear of falling, and emotional well-being among older adults, primarily from low socioeconomic status (SES) backgrounds-a group often underrepresented in exergame research.Method: We engaged 48 participants, primarily from low-SES communities in Singapore for a 4-week community-based exergaming intervention. Participants were divided into four groups as follows: (1) conventional exercise alone, (2) exergames alone, (3) exergames with a health coach, and (4) exergames with a peer. Using two-way repeated-measures ANOVA, we analyzed the effects of these interventions.Results: The findings revealed that all exergaming modes positively influenced exercise intentions, fear of falling, and emotional well-being to varying extents. Notably, exergaming with a health coach significantly improved participants' exercise intentions and emotional well-being, underscoring the value of expert guidance in motivating and supporting older adults in adopting healthier lifestyles. Exergaming with a peer was most effective in reducing fear of falling, highlighting the importance of social support and peer interaction in addressing physical health concerns among this population.Conclusion: This study emphasizes the potential of tailored exergame interventions incorporating various social interactions to improve health outcomes for older adults, contributing to more inclusive health promotion strategies.

[Title]    Effectiveness of feedback-based technology on physical and cognitive abilities in the elderly.
[Journal]  FRONTIERS IN AGING NEUROSCIENCE 14.
[Abstract] Aging raises a social and health challenge because the passing of time causes changes in cognitive and physical functions that impair functionality and quality of life. In addition, advancements in technology and information technology have led to the development of new techniques for retraining based on the feedback technology provides. To solve the negative consequences of aging, a randomized clinical trial was carried out to assess the effectiveness of a protocol using feedback-based technology to improve physical and cognitive functions in older adults. For the purpose of this study, 200 patients were selected from a Social and Community Services Center in the province of Seville and only 46 of them became participants of the study (after applying the inclusion criteria). These patients were divided into two groups: control and experimental. Physical and cognitive abilities were assessed using the Miniexamen cognoscitivo Test (an adaptation of the MiniMental examination test), Yesevage's Depression Scale, Oddball Test, Attention Network Test, Berg Scale, Tinetti Scale, and Timed Up and Go Test. The intervention applied to the experimental group consisted of a supervised protocol using the Nintendo (R) Wii video game console and the Wii-Fit(C) video game during 16 sessions, 2 times a week with a duration of 30 min per session. The control group did not receive any treatment. The experimental group showed statistically significant improvements in all the physical variables (balance, gait, autonomy, and fall risk), as other authors had proven, and in memory and reaction times; there were no improvements in attention networks. The control group (placebo) even showed a decrease in their functions, with worse results on the Timed up and Go test Scale. The intervention using feedback-based technology has been proven effective in improving physical and cognitive abilities and in preventing and promoting healthy aging.

[Title]    Enhancement of Anticipatory Postural Adjustments by Virtual Reality in Older Adults with Cognitive and Motor Deficits: A Randomised Trial.
[Journal]  GERIATRICS 6(3).
[Abstract] Background: Postural activities involved in balance control integrate the anticipatory postural adjustments (APA) that stabilize balance and posture, facilitating arm movements and walking initiation and allowing an optimal coordination between posture and movement. Several studies reported the significant benefits of virtual reality (VR) exercises in frail older adults to decrease the anxiety of falling and to induce improvements in behavioural and cognitive abilities in rehabilitation processes. The aim of this study was thus to test the efficiency of a VR system on the enhancement of the APA period, compared to the use of a Nintendo Wii system. Methods: Frail older adults (n = 37) were included in this study who were randomized and divided into a VR exercises group (VR group) or a control group using the Nintendo Wii system (CTRL group). Finally, 22 patients were included in the data treatment. APA were studied through muscular activation timings measured with electromyographic activities. The functional reach test, the gait speed, and the time up and go were also evaluated before and after a 3-week training phase. Results and discussion: As the main results, the training phase with VR improved the APA and the functional reach test score along the antero-posterior axis. Together, these results highlight the ability of a VR training phase to induce neuromuscular adaptations during the APA period in frail older adults. Then, it underlines the effective transfer from learning carried out during the VR training movements to control balance abilities in a more daily life context.

[Title]    Physical and Affective Physical Literacy Domains Improved After a Six-Week Exergame Exercise Program in Older Adults: A Randomized Controlled Clinical Trial.
[Journal]  GAMES FOR HEALTH JOURNAL 12(5): 366-376.
[Abstract] Introduction: We investigated the effects of an exergames-based exercise program for older adults, and its benefits on their physical literacy (PL) domains, such as physical (mobility skills), affective (motivation and confidence), cognitive (knowledge about physical activity [PA]), and behavioral (daily exertion) when compared with a conventional exercise program and no training (NT) (control).Material and Methods: Forty older adults (mean age 72 years) volunteered and were randomized within three groups-exergame training (ET; n = 15), conventional training (CT; n = 14), and NT (n = 11). ET group performed training sessions based on a commercially available exergame console, while the CT group enrolled in a convention exercise program (aerobic, strength, balance, and flexibility exercises). The training program was conducted three times a week for 6 weeks. The Timed Up and Go Test (TUG), Exercise Confidence Survey (ECS), Motives for Physical Activity Measure-Revised (MPAM-R), Knowledge and Understanding Questionnaire (K&UQ), and total PA tracking (using wearable technology) were used as the study's outcomes. Outcome variables were measured at preintervention (week 0), postintervention (week 6), and at the time of final follow-up (week 9).Results: We observed a reduction in the ET TUG time at postintervention and follow-up. Also, a significant main effect for group and moment of measurement was observed for the Fitness-Health subscore, derived from MPAM-R. The values demonstrated by ET and CT were statistically different (P = 0.01) and a within-group comparison revealed significant differences in the ET from preintervention to both postintervention and follow-up (both, P = 0.01). We did not observe any other significant difference.Conclusion: Our results suggest that a 6-week exergame-based training program may have the potential in improving the physical and affective domains of PL in community-dwelling older adults. The topics related to fitness and health seem to be of interest in this population and programs can make use of them to improve the PL domains.
[Answer]   YES
[Response] YES. The paper meets the criteria for being about the use of exergames to prevent falls in the elderly:. 1. Intervention Targets: The study involves older adults with a mean age of 72 years.
2. Intervention: The intervention includes an exergame-based exercise program using a commercially available exergame console.

[Title]    Immersive Virtual Reality as a Novel Physical Therapy Approach for Nonagenarians: Usability and Effects on Balance Outcomes of a Game-Based Exercise Program.
[Journal]  JOURNAL OF CLINICAL MEDICINE 11(13).
[Abstract] Physical exercise has been recognized as an important strategy in the promotion of healthy aging. Positive effects on older adults' motor ability are brought about by engaging their motor skills and promoting sensorimotor learning and cortical plasticity. These processes could be increased with the use of immersive virtual reality (IVR) technology, since the multisensory stimulation is greater. The aim of this study was to explore the usability and balance effects of an IVR exercise program in community-dwelling nonagenarian people. A sample of 12 women were allocated to an experimental group (EG n = 6; 91.67 +/- 1.63 years) and a control group (CG n = 6; 90.83 +/- 2.64 years). For 10 weeks, the EG used a commercial IVR exergame three times a week. All the sample completed the program without adverse effects (without Simulator Sickness Questionnaire symptoms). Post-gaming usability was good (System Usability Scale 78.33). The EG improved some balance parameters significantly (Tinetti test: balance (10.97 %; Sig = 0.017), gait (9.23%; Sig = 0.047) and total score (10.20%; Sig = 0.014) and maintained total TUG test times (-0.45%)). There were significant differences between groups (Tinetti test: balance (Sig = 0.004) and total score (Sig = 0.0032)).

[Title]    Using the Nintendo™ Wii to Improve Physical Function and Reduce the Risk of Falls in Older Adults: A Randomized Controlled Clinical Trial.
[Journal]  SENSORS 24(19).
[Abstract] (1) Background: Numerous exercise programs that improve physical capacity and the risk of falls in older adults have been proposed with varying degrees of success. A novel approach may be to use a video game system that uses real-time force feedback to train older adults. The aim of this study was to evaluate the effects of a Nintendo (TM) Wii-based exercise program on physical function and risk of falls in older people. (2) Methods: This 12-week randomized controlled clinical trial involved 73 participants: 36 individuals participating in a control group (CG) and 37 in an experimental group (EG) participating in a combined program. Balance was measured using the Tinetti scale, flexibility was assessed with the back scratch test and the sit-and-reach test, and lower body strength was assessed with the 30 s chair stand-up test. (3) Results: The results of this study show significant improvements in balance, gait, flexibility, and strength of the lower limbs compared to a control group. (4) Conclusions: A Nintendo (TM) Wii-based exercise program for seniors produces improvements in the physical health of older adults. These improvements highlight the importance of integrating physical exercise through video games as an effective strategy to improve the general health and quality of life of older adults.

[Title]    A randomised controlled pilot study of a Nintendo Ring Fit Adventure™ balance and strengthening exercise program in community-dwelling older adults with a history of falls.
[Journal]  AUSTRALASIAN JOURNAL ON AGEING 43(3): 533-544.
[Abstract] Objectives: This pilot study examined the feasibility, acceptability, and effects of a Nintendo Ring Fit Adventure (TM)-based balance and muscle strengthening exercise program in community-dwelling older adults with a history of falls. Methods: Older adults who have had at least one fall in the past year were randomly assigned to an experimental (n = 21) or control group (n = 21). The experimental group performed 16 exercise sessions in total, lasting 60 min each, twice a week for 8 weeks, whereas the control group received usual care. Feasibility was evaluated based on the scores of participants in the exercises. Acceptance was evaluated using a customised questionnaire examining participants' self-perceived enjoyment, feasibility and improvements. Clinical outcomes including balance (Mini-BESTest), lower limb muscle strength (Five-Time Sit-to-Stand test), mobility (Timed-Up and Go test), dual-task ability (Timed-Up and Go test-Dual Task), fear of falling (Icon-FES) and executive function (Color Trails Test) were evaluated at baseline and 8 weeks. Results: Thirty-one participants (74%) finished the 8-week assessment. The experimental group significantly improved their scores in six out of eight exercises (all p < .031). The mean scores of the self-perceived enjoyment, feasibility and improvement domains of the acceptability questionnaire were 3.46 +/- .53, 3.08 +/- .59, and 3.47 +/- .57 respectively. A significant improvement in the anticipatory subscore of the Mini-BESTest was found in the experimental group compared to the control group (p = .02; Partial eta squared = .14). Conclusions: The Nintendo Ring Fit Adventure (TM)-based exercise program was feasible, acceptable, and potentially effective in community-dwelling older adults with a history of falls.

[Title]    Improvement in the physiological function and standing stability based on kinect multimedia for older people.
[Journal]  JOURNAL OF PHYSICAL THERAPY SCIENCE 28(4): 1343-1348.
[Abstract] [Purpose] The increase in the Taiwanese older population is associated with age-related inconveniences. Finding adequate and simple physical activities to help the older people maintaining their physiological function and preventing them from falls has become an urgent social issue. [Subjects and Methods] This study aimed to design a virtual exercise training game suitable for Taiwanese older people. This system will allow for the maintenance of the physiological function and standing stability through physical exercise, while using a virtual reality game. The participants can easily exercise in a carefree, interactive environment. This study will use Kinect for Windows for physical movement detection and Unity software for virtual world development. [Results] Group A and B subjects were involved in the exercise training method of Kinect interactive multimedia for 12 weeks. The results showed that the functional reach test and the unipedal stance test improved significantly. [Conclusion] The physiological function and standing stability of the group A subjects were examined at six weeks post training. The results showed that these parameters remained constant. This proved that the proposed system provide substantial support toward the preservation of the Taiwanese older people' physiological function and standing stability.

[Title]    The Effects of Virtual Reality-based Balance Training on Balance of the Elderly.
[Journal]  JOURNAL OF PHYSICAL THERAPY SCIENCE 26(4): 615-617.
[Abstract] [Purpose] The objective of this study was to determine the effects of virtual reality-based balance training on balance of the elderly. [Methods] The subjects were 32 healthy elderly people aged between 65 and 80, who were divided into a VR (virtual reality) training group (n=17) and a control group (n=15). The VR training group engaged in a 30-minute exercise session using Wii Fit three times a week for eight weeks, while the control group received no intervention. The balance of the two groups was measured before and after the intervention. [Results] According to the Romberg Test conducted to examine the effects of the training on balance, both the area covered by the body's center of pressure movement, and movement distances per unit area of the body's center of pressure envelope significantly decreased in the VR training group. Moreover, the two groups showed significant differences in balance. [Conclusion] Virtual reality training is effective at improving the balance of the healthy elderly. Thus, virtual reality training can be proposed as a form of fall prevention exercise for the elderly.

[Title]    Effect of Cyber-Golfing on Balance Amongst the Elderly in Hong Kong: A Pilot Randomised Trial.
[Journal]  HONG KONG JOURNAL OF OCCUPATIONAL THERAPY 26: 9-13.
[Abstract] Background/Objective: Recent evidence showed that golf can develop balance amongst the elderly. This study aimed at evaluating if exergaming, in particular cyber-golfing, can be a feasible and inexpensive alternative to this valuable exercise.Methods: Twenty healthy community-dwelling elderly were recruited, and they were randomly assigned to either the experimental group (n = 10) or the control group (n = 10). Daily cyber-golfing training for 2 weeks was assigned to the participants of the experimental group, where regular table games with equal lengths and durations were arranged for the control group.Results: The results revealed that the participants in the experimental group showed significantly better post-training performances in the functional-reach test, F-(2,F-17) = 5.16, p = .04, and single-leg-stance test, F-(2,F-17) = 5.32, p = .03, than those in the control group.Conclusion: The results of this study suggest that cyber-golfing might be an alternative to golfing, which is capable of enhancing balance ability amongst community-dwelling elderly. The potential of exergaming as a clinical tool for geriatric rehabilitation was discussed. (C) Copyright 2015, Hong Kong Occupational Therapy Association. Published by Elsevier (Singapore) Pte Ltd.

[Title]    The effect of transcranial direct current stimulation associated with video game training on the postural balance of older women in the community: A blind, randomized, clinical trial.
[Journal]  PHYSIOTHERAPY RESEARCH INTERNATIONAL 29(1).
[Abstract] Background: Falls are frequent in older adults and can cause trauma, injury, and death. Fall prevention with virtual reality presents good results in improving postural control. Transcranial Direct Current Stimulation (tDCS) has been used with the same aim; however, the combination of the two techniques has still been little studied.Purpose: To assess whether tDCS can enhance the effect of video game training (VGT) on improving the postural balance of healthy older women.Method: A blinded, randomized, controlled clinical trial was conducted with 57 older women who were randomized to three balance training groups: Control Group (VGT), Anodal Group (VGT combined with anodic tDCS-atDCS), and Sham Group (VGT combined with sham tDCS-stDCS). Balance training was performed twice a week for four weeks, totalizing eight 20-min sessions using VGT associated with tDCS. Postural balance was assessed pre-and post-training and 30 days after the end of the eight sessions using the Mini-Balance Evaluation Systems Test.Results: Compared to pre-intervention the Mini BEST test increased similarly in the three groups in post-intervention (control: pre 23.7 +/- 2.8 to post 27.0 +/- 2.2; anodal: pre 24.4 +/- 1 to post 27.7 +/- 0.8 and sham: pre 24.2 +/- 1.9 to post 26.5 +/- 1.6; p < 0.001) and follow-up (control: pre 23.7 +/- 2.8 to follow-up 26.8 +/- 2.3; anodal: pre 24.4 +/- 1 to follow-up 27.3 +/- 1.4 and sham: pre 24.2 +/- 1.9 to follow-up 26.8 +/- 1.5; p < 0.001).Conclusion: There was an improvement in the postural balance of the three training groups that were independent of tDCS.Discussion: Some studies have shown the positive tDCS effects associated with other tasks to improve balance. However, these results convey the effects of only anodic-tDCS compared to sham-tDCS. Possibly, the effect of VGT surpassed the tDCS effects, promoting a ceiling effect from the combination of these two therapies. However, studies with other therapies combined with tDCS for older adults deserve to be investigated, as well as in frail older people.

[Title]    Combining Stochastic Resonance Vibration With Exergaming for Motor-Cognitive Training in Long-Term Care; A Sham-Control Randomized Controlled Pilot Trial.
[Journal]  FRONTIERS IN MEDICINE 7.
[Abstract] Purpose: Physical and mental functions allow classifying older adults as "Go-Go" (independent functioning); "Slow-Go" (in need of care with a slight handicap); and "No-Go" (in need of care with severe functional limitation). The latter group exhibits reduced exercise tolerance. More recently technology-based motor-cognitive types of training services emerged as a possible training service. This study examined the use of technology including stochastic resonance whole-body vibration and Exergame-dance training for motor-cognitive training in care home dwelling adults.Methods: Seventeen older adults (10 women, 7 men, age range: 79-98) were randomly assigned to the intervention (IG, n = 9) or the sham group (SG, n = 8). IG performed five sets of 1-min whole-body vibration with 1-min rest in between, three times a week for the first 4 weeks of the training period with varying frequency. From weeks five to eight the Exergame-dance training was conducted after the vibration sessions. SG performed a stochastic resonance whole-body vibration training with the same terms applied, however, with a fixed frequency of 1 Hz, Noise 1. From weeks five to eight a passive trampoline-programme of 5 min was applied following the vibration sessions. Primary outcome was the Short Physical Performance Battery (SPPB). Secondary outcomes were the Trail Making Test A and B (TMT A & B) and the Falls Efficacy Scale-International (FES-I). Outcomes were measured at baseline, after 4 and 8 weeks of intervention and at follow-up (4 weeks after the intervention). The non-parametric Puri and Sen rank-order test was applied, followed by an ANOVA for repeated measures to analyse main and interaction effects. Mann-Whitney U-Test was used to determine differences between the groups.Results: The post-hoc analysis showed significant effects on the SPPB total score with large effect sizes from baseline to 8 weeks (+72%, p = 0.005, eta(2) = 0.423). The TMT part B displayed significant improvements with large effect sizes from baseline to 8 weeks (+17.5%, p = 0.002, eta(2) = 0.779) and to follow-up (+21%, p = 0.001, eta(2) = 0.827).Conclusion: The technology based 8-week training programme consisting of a combination of stochastic resonance whole-body vibration and Exergame-dance training showed beneficial effects on both physical and cognitive performance in older care home dwelling adults.

[Title]    The Influence of Video Game Training with and without Subpatelar Bandage in Mobility and Gait Speed on Elderly Female Fallers.
[Journal]  Journal of aging research 2018: 9415093-9415093.
[Abstract] OBJECTIVES: The aim of the study was to investigate the effect of balance training with Nintendo Wii technology, with and without the use of additional sensory information (subpatellar bandage), in the functional mobility and gait speed of elderly female fallers.METHODS: Twenty elderly women were divided into two groups: group I: trained with the use of the Nintendo Wii; group II: trained using the Nintendo Wii and the addition of sensory information (subpatellar bandage). The functional mobility was assessed with the Timed up and Go test (TUG) and gait speed with the 10m test. The tests were carried out with and without the use of the subpatellar bandage. The training was carried out within sessions of 30 minutes, twice a week, using three different games (Penguin Slide, Table Tilt, and Tightrope).RESULTS: There was an increase in the gait speed and a decrease in the TUG time in both groups, independently of the sensory condition used (p < 0.05). In the short term, the subpatellar bandage improved the TUG time (p < 0.05) and the gait speed (p < 0.01).CONCLUSION: The training for postural balance with virtual reality was effective for improving functional mobility and gait speed of elderly female fallers. The subpatellar bandage did not maximize the effect of training.

[Title]    Neural correlates of weight-shift training in older adults: a randomized controlled study.
[Journal]  SCIENTIFIC REPORTS 13(1).
[Abstract] Mediolateral weight-shifting is an important aspect of postural control. As it is currently unknown whether a short training session of mediolateral weight-shifting in a virtual reality (VR) environment can improve weight-shifting, we investigated this question and also probed the impact of practice on brain activity. Forty healthy older adults were randomly allocated to a training (EXP, n=20, age=70.80 (65-77), 9 females) or a control group (CTR, n=20, age=71.65 (65-82), 10 females). The EXP performed a 25-min weight-shift training in a VR-game, whereas the CTR rested for the same period. Weight-shifting speed in both single- (ST) and dual-task (DT) conditions was determined before, directly after, and 24 h after intervention. Functional Near-Infrared Spectroscopy (fNIRS) assessed the oxygenated hemoglobin (HbO(2)) levels in five cortical regions of interest. Weight-shifting in both ST and DT conditions improved in EXP but not in CTR, and these gains were retained after 24 h. Effects transferred to wider limits of stability post-training in EXP versus CTR. HbO(2) levels in the left supplementary motor area were significantly increased directly after training in EXP during ST (change<SEM), and in the left somatosensory cortex during DT (change>SEM). We interpret these changes in the motor coordination and sensorimotor integration areas of the cortex as possibly learning-related.

[Title]    Falls Risk in Relation to Activity Exposure in High-Risk Older Adults.
[Journal]  JOURNALS OF GERONTOLOGY SERIES A-BIOLOGICAL SCIENCES AND MEDICAL SCIENCES 75(6): 1198-1205.
[Abstract] Background: Physical activity is linked to many positive health outcomes, stimulating the development of exercise programs. However, many falls occur while walking and so promoting activity might paradoxically increase fall rates, causing injuries, and worse quality of life. The relationship between activity exposure and fall rates remains unclear. We investigated the relationship between walking activity (exposure to risk) and fall rates before and after an exercise program (V-TIME).Methods: One hundred and nine older fallers, 38 fallers with mild cognitive impairment (MCI), and 128 fallers with Parkinson's disease (PD) were randomly assigned to one of two active interventions: treadmill training only or treadmill training combined with a virtual reality component. Participants were tested before and after the interventions. Free-living walking activity was characterized by volume, pattern, and variability of ambulatory bouts using an accelerometer positioned on the lower back for 1 week. To evaluate that relationship between fall risk and activity, a normalized index was determined expressing fall rates relative to activity exposure (FRA index), with higher scores indicating a higher risk of falls per steps taken.Results: At baseline, the FRA index was higher for fallers with PD compared to those with MCI and older fallers. Walking activity did not change after the intervention for the groups but the FRA index decreased significantly for all groups (p <= .035).Conclusions: This work showed that V-TIME interventions reduced falls risk without concurrent change in walking activity. We recommend using the FRA index in future fall prevention studies to better understand the nature of intervention programs.

[Title]    Video Gaming in Older People: What Are the Implications for Cognitive Functions?
[Journal]  BRAIN SCIENCES 14(7).
[Abstract] Mild cognitive impairment impacts a sizable segment of the older population, and often evolves into dementia within a few years. At this stage, subjects may benefit from non-pharmacological therapies that can delay or stop the progression of the mild cognitive impairment into dementia and are crucial for improvement in the subject's quality of life, while also being easily accessible and safe for use. Many research studies have shown that a variety of exercises, including cognitive training, have the potential to enhance or optimize cognitive function and general well-being. Recently, many authors have suggested video games as a promising approach for cognitive training and neurorehabilitation in older people, thanks to their increasing motivation and training effects through immersion in stimulating environments. Under this premise, our narrative review's objective is to discuss and summarize the body of existing material on the role of video games in improving cognitive performance, daily life activities, and depression symptoms in older individuals with different levels of cognitive decline. From the papers reviewed, it emerged that older subjects trained with video games showed a significant improvement in cognitive functions, sleep quality, and psychiatric symptoms, positioning video games as an intriguing and useful tool.
[Answer]   YES
[Response] NO. The paper is a narrative review that discusses the role of video games in improving cognitive performance, daily life activities, and depression symptoms in older individuals. It does not specifically focus on the use of exergames to prevent falls in the elderly, nor does it report the results of a randomized controlled trial. Therefore, it does not meet the criteria for the answer "YES."

[Title]    The effects of exergaming on pain, postural control, technology acceptance and flow experience in older people with chronic musculoskeletal pain: a randomised controlled trial.
[Journal]  BMC SPORTS SCIENCE MEDICINE AND REHABILITATION 12(1).
[Abstract] Background: Older people with chronic musculoskeletal pain are at risk of falls. This study aimed to investigate the effects of exergaming on pain and postural control in older people with chronic musculoskeletal pain. Secondary outcomes were technology acceptance, flow experience, perceived physical exertion, expended mental effort and heart rate.Methods: Fifty four older adults (age: 71 +/- 5 years) with chronic musculoskeletal pain were randomised into 2 groups. Group 1 received exergaming training using the Interactive Rehabilitation and Exercise System (IREX (R)). Group 2 undertook traditional gym-based exercise (TGB). Both groups completed twice weekly 40-min exercise sessions for 6 weeks. Perceived pain was measured using a numeric pain rating scale and the Multidimensional Affect and Pain Survey questionnaire. Postural control was measured as sway using a Kistler (TM) force platform. Technology acceptance was measured with the Unified Theory of Acceptance and Use of Technology questionnaire and flow experience with the Flow State Scale. Physiological measures of perceived physical exertion, expended mental effort and heart rate were recorded during all sessions.Results: The exergaming group demonstrated significant reductions in pain intensity and thermal pain including a near significant approach in physical engagement in comparison to TGB group. Although no intervention effects on postural control were found, the exergaming group showed significant improvements in three sway measures (AP SD, ML SD and AP range) over time whereas significant improvements in ML range were found in the TGB group. Relating to technology acceptance, significant intervention effects on social influence and behavioural intention were found in the TGB group instead, although both groups demonstrated increases of acceptance over time. Regarding flow experience, concentration at task was significantly influenced in the TGB group and significant increases in flow variables over time were observed in both groups. Significant increases over time in perceived physical exertion and expended mental effort were found in both groups.Conclusion: Our findings support the potential of exergaming to alleviate pain and improve balance in older people with chronic musculoskeletal pain. Both forms of exercise are acceptable, intrinsically motivating and show evidence of benefit to older people with chronic musculoskeletal pain.

[Title]    Fall-Prone Older People's Attitudes towards the Use of Virtual Reality Technology for Fall Prevention.
[Journal]  GERONTOLOGY 63(6): 590-598.
[Abstract] Background: Virtual reality (VR) technology is a relatively new rehabilitation tool that can deliver a combination of cognitive and motor training for fall prevention. The attitudes of older people to such training are currently unclear. Objective: This study aimed to investigate: (1) the attitudes of fall-prone older people towards fall prevention exercise with and without VR; (2) attitudinal changes after intervention with and without VR; and (3) user satisfaction following fall prevention exercise with and without VR. Methods: A total of 281 fall-prone older people were randomly assigned to an experimental group receiving treadmill training augmented by VR (TT+ VR, n = 144) or a control group receiving treadmill training alone (TT, n = 137). Two questionnaires were used to measure (1) attitudes towards fall prevention exercise with and without VR (AQ); and (2) user satisfaction (USQ). AQ was evaluated at baseline and after intervention. USQ was measured after intervention only. Results: The AQ revealed that most participants had positive attitudes to-wards fall prevention exercise at baseline (82.2%) and after intervention (80.6%; p = 0.144). In contrast, only 53.6% were enthusiastic about fall prevention exercise with VR at baseline. These attitudes positively changed after intervention (83.1%; p < 0.001), and 99.2% indicated that they enjoyed TT+ VR. Correlation analyses showed that postintervention attitudes were strongly related to user satisfaction (USQ: r = 0.503; p < 0.001). Conclusions: Older people's attitudes towards fall prevention exercise with VR were positively influenced by their experience. From the perspective of the user, VR is an attractive training mode, and thus improving service provision for older people is important. (C) 2017 S. Karger AG, Basel

[Title]    Multicomponent physical exercise with simultaneous cognitive training to enhance dual-task walking of older adults: a secondary analysis of a 6-month randomized controlled trial with 1-year follow-up.
[Journal]  CLINICAL INTERVENTIONS IN AGING 10: 1711-1732.
[Abstract] Background: About one-third of people older than 65 years fall at least once a year. Physical exercise has been previously demonstrated to improve gait, enhance physical fitness, and prevent falls. Nonetheless, the addition of cognitive training components may potentially increase these effects, since cognitive impairment is related to gait irregularities and fall risk. We hypothesized that simultaneous cognitive-physical training would lead to greater improvements in dual-task (DT) gait compared to exclusive physical training.Methods: Elderly persons older than 70 years and without cognitive impairment were randomly assigned to the following groups: 1) virtual reality video game dancing (DANCE), 2) treadmill walking with simultaneous verbal memory training (MEMORY), or 3) treadmill walking (PHYS). Each program was complemented with strength and balance exercises. Two 1-hour training sessions per week over 6 months were applied. Gait variables, functional fitness (Short Physical Performance Battery, 6-minute walk), and fall frequencies were assessed at baseline, after 3 months and 6 months, and at 1-year follow-up. Multiple regression analyses with planned comparisons were carried out.Results: Eighty-nine participants were randomized to three groups initially; 71 completed the training and 47 were available at 1-year follow-up. DANCE/MEMORY showed a significant advantage compared to PHYS in DT costs of step time variability at fast walking (P=0.044). Training-specific gait adaptations were found on comparing DANCE and MEMORY: DANCE reduced step time at fast walking (P=0.007) and MEMORY reduced gait variability in DT and DT costs at preferred walking speed (both trend P=0.062). Global linear time effects showed improved gait (P<0.05), functional fitness (P<0.05), and reduced fall frequency (-77%, P<0.001). Only single-task fast walking, gait variability at preferred walking speed, and Short Physical Performance Battery were reduced at follow-up (all P<0.05 or trend).Conclusion: Long-term multicomponent cognitive-physical and exclusive physical training programs demonstrated similar potential to counteract age-related decline in physical functioning.

[Title]    Exergame and Balance Training Modulate Prefrontal Brain Activity during Walking and Enhance Executive Function in Older Adults.
[Journal]  FRONTIERS IN AGING NEUROSCIENCE 8.
[Abstract] Different types of exercise training have the potential to induce structural and functional brain plasticity in the elderly. Thereby, functional brain adaptations were observed during cognitive tasks in functional magnetic resonance imaging studies that correlated with improved cognitive performance. This study aimed to investigate if exercise training induces functional brain plasticity during challenging treadmill walking and elicits associated changes in cognitive executive functions. Forty-two elderly participants were recruited and randomly assigned to either interactive cognitive-motor video game dancing (DANCE) or balance and stretching training (BALANCE). The 8-week intervention included three sessions of 30 min per week and was completed by 33 participants (mean age 74.9 +/- 6.9 years). Prefrontal cortex (PFC) activity during preferred and fast walking speed on a treadmill was assessed applying functional near infrared spectroscopy pre- and post-intervention. Additionally, executive functions comprising shifting, inhibition, and working memory were assessed. The results showed that both interventions significantly reduced left and right hemispheric PFC oxygenation during the acceleration of walking (p < 0.05 or trend, r = 0.25-0.36), while DANCE showed a larger reduction at the end of the 30-s walking task compared to BALANCE in the left PFC [F-(1,F- 31) = 3.54, p = 0.035, r = 0.32]. These exercise training induced modulations in PFC oxygenation correlated with improved executive functions (p < 0.05 or trend, r = 0.31-0.50). The observed reductions in PFC activity may release cognitive resources to focus attention on other processes while walking, which could be relevant to improve mobility and falls prevention in the elderly. This study provides a deeper understanding of the associations between exercise training, brain function during walking, and cognition in older adults.

[Title]    Effects of Playful Exercise of Older Adults on Balance and Physical Activity: a Randomized Controlled Trial.
[Journal]  JOURNAL OF POPULATION AGEING 13(2): 207-222.
[Abstract] There is evidence that one of the most important approaches to improving the healthy ageing of older adults is for them to carry out daily physical activity. However, motivation to engage in physical activity is often low in old age. This study investigated the potential of engaging older adults in playful exercise to increase physical activity and balance. A randomised control trial (RCT) was performed with 26 independently living older adults (initially 38, but 12 were lost to illness or death during the course of the project), mean age 83.54 (SD: 7.12), 19 women. Participants were randomly allocated to intervention (n = 16) or control (n = 12) (originally 19 in each group). The intervention consisted of playful exercise on Moto tiles 6 * 2 min twice a week over 10 weeks, while control group participants engaged in normal daily activities. The intervention group participants improved functional balance (Berg's Balance Score) by an average of 5.02 points, and the control group by 2.58 points (p = 0.11). No between-group difference was observed in physical activities outside exercise sessions (p = 0.82). The difference in gain of balance as measured by BBS was below statistical significance, as a result of the sample size being too small. However, trial results suggest that older pre-frail and frail adults who engage in a moderate playful exercise programme over at least 10 weeks may potentially experience a modest gain in balance. Moreover, the playful exercise created a joyous social atmosphere among the participants who spontaneously remarked that the play sessions were much more fun than their standard light exercise programme of one hour twice a week. This motivational outcome is important for adherence to any exercise programme and indeed for general well-being.

[Title]    Recalibrating disparities in perceived and actual balance abilities in older adults: a mixed-methods evaluation of a novel exergaming intervention.
[Journal]  JOURNAL OF NEUROENGINEERING AND REHABILITATION 15.
[Abstract] Background: Published reports suggest a disparity between perceived and actual balance abilities, a trait associated with increased fall-risk in older adults. We investigate whether it is possible to 'recalibrate' these disparities using a novel gaming intervention.Methods: We recruited 26 older adults for a 4-week intervention in which they participated in 8-sessions using a novel gaming intervention designed to provide explicit, augmented feedback related to postural control. Measures of perceived balance abilities (Falls Efficacy Scale-International) and actual postural control (limits of stability) were assessed pre-and post-intervention. We used focus groups to elicit the opinions of participants about how the game may have influenced balance abilities and confidence.Results: A stronger alignment was observed between postural control and perceived balance capabilities post-intervention (i.e., significant correlations between Falls Efficacy Scale-International scores and limits of stability which were not present pre-intervention). Also, significant improvements in measures of postural control were observed, with these improvements confined to the aspects of postural control for which the exergame provided explicit, augmented feedback. Qualitative data revealed that the intervention made participants more "aware" of their balance abilities.Conclusions: Our results demonstrate that it is possible to recalibrate the perceptions of older adults relating to their balance abilities through a targeted, short-term intervention. We propose that the post-intervention improvements in postural control may have been, in part, the result of this recalibration; with altered perceptions leading to changes in balance performance. Findings support the application of novel interventions aimed at addressing the psychological factors associated with elderly falls.

[Title]    Effects of Nintendo Wii fit game training on balance among Lebanese older adults.
[Journal]  AGING CLINICAL AND EXPERIMENTAL RESEARCH 32(11): 2271-2278.
[Abstract] Background Falls are the second leading cause of accidental death, with persons older than 65 years being the most affected. Moreover, gait- and balance-related problems represent the most consistent predictors of future falls. Aims The aim was to determine the effects of Wii fit game training on dynamic and static balance among Lebanese older adults. Methods A randomized-controlled trial was conducted over a period of 8 weeks, where institutionalized older adults with no history of falls were randomized into two groups. The participants of each group were carefully followed up during the intervention and data collection periods. The intervention group was trained for standing balance during a 40-min session, starting with the "Soccer Heading" game during the first 4 weeks, followed by the "Table Tilt" game for the remaining 4 weeks. Timed up-and-go (TUG) test and the Nintendo Wii Balance Board were used to measure the dynamic and static balance, respectively, both at baseline and post-intervention. Results Sixty-four participants recruited from both, the Tyre and Saida districts were enrolled in the study. Within-group comparison of TUG test values between baseline and post-intervention; both groups showed an extremely significant difference (P = 0.000). Similarly, the between-group comparison showed a significant difference (P = 0.013). Concerning the center of pressure measures, only the intervention group showed a very significant improvement between baseline and post-intervention measures (P = 0.002). Conclusion Wii fit balance training is a valid method for improving both dynamic and static balance among Lebanese older adults.

[Title]    Effects of group-based virtual reality training on activities of daily living and functional outcomes in older adults: a randomised control trial.
[Journal]  DISABILITY AND REHABILITATION-ASSISTIVE TECHNOLOGY.
[Abstract] Virtual reality training (VRT), a fun, inexpensive and accessible technology, has the potential to improve activities of daily living (ADL) and functional status in older adults. The potential impact of VRT can be increased through group-based training. The aim of this study was to investigate the effect of group- based VRT on ADL and functional outcomes in older adults over 65 years of age. Forty-three older adults included in the study were randomized into three groups (group- based VRT, individual VRT and control group). VRT was performed with Xbox 360 Kinect twice a week for 8 weeks. Each session lasted 45 min. Physical activity level, satisfaction level with physical activity, mood, mobility and balance performance, functional exercise capacity and ADL were evaluated. 36 people completed the study. A significant group x time interaction was found in Timed Up and Go test (TUG) (F [2, 57] = 8.60; eta(2)= 0.004, P= <.001) and in Single Leg Stance Test (SLST)) (F [2, 57] = 5.69; eta(2)= 8.509 x 10(-4), P= <.007). After 8 weeks group- based VRT showed better scores in overall TUG (p < .001) and SLST (p= .015), whereas individual VRT and control group did not exhibit significant changes. Our results suggested that 8 weeks group- based VRT could improve mobility and balance performance in older adults. {Graphical abstract}

[Title]    Effects of Wii Virtual Reality Exercise Program on the Balance Function of Elderlies Living Alone with High Fall Risk.
[Journal]  Asia-pacific Journal of Convergent Research Interchange 7(4): 1-12.
[Abstract] Fall is deﬁned as an abrupt, unexpected event where one comes to rest on the ground or floors. This is one of the major causes of disability among adults and elders, inducing reduced mobility and low quality of life. The elderlies living alone were in high-risk of frequent falls, thus, various rehabilitation interventions for them were needed including exercise programs, which was found to be useful. In this study, an alternative, which is virtual reality, was used as a viable intervention for fall prevention. Specifically, it used the Nintendo Wii, a small and cheap personal game console, on the exercise physicomental playing. The aims of present studies were to define through quantitative measuring the effect of virtual reality programs in Wii sports games on the balance of elderly people who are living alone and at the risk of falling. Computerized dynamic posturography (CDP) was applied as the data collection procedure to quantitatively measure the effect of virtual reality programs in Wii sports games on the balance of elderly people. The study included 30 patients over 65 years of age who lived alone and had a self-reported balance deficit or fall history before the evaluation. The participants were casted at random to empirical (n=15) or control group (n=15). The empirical group kept three Wii balance exercises composed by forty minutes per week totalizing for 12 weeks. The control group have not performed any empirical program other than conventional recreational therapy. This study used a CDP to evaluate all patients at the starting and termination point of the study. In addition, all subjects were assessed by the Short Form of Geriatric Depression Scale (GDS) to screen their depression level and to measure the therapeutic effects. A statistical significance was verified among patients about treatments utilizing t-test. After 36 experimental times, the sensory organization test showed significant differences in the fifth and sixth conditions and a vestibular ratio of the empirical group from the basis to the after-test. In opposition, littile statistically compelling discrepancy was detected in control groups. The empirical group revealed a compelling betterment in the GDS following the program compared to the control group. This study demonstrated quantitatively that a virtual reality exercise program, such as in Wii, may improve the balancing ability of older people who live alone and at high risk of falls. The Wii program, which does not take up much space, is inexpensive, easy to move and install, and can be widely applied to physical therapy for elderly patients who live alone and at high risk of falling.

[Title]    Comparison of Nonimmersive Virtual Reality and Task-Oriented Circuit Training on Gait, Balance and Cognition Among Elderly Population: A Single-Blind Randomized Control Trial.
[Journal]  GAMES FOR HEALTH JOURNAL 13(3): 164-171.
[Abstract] Purpose: The purpose of this study was to determine the effects of nonimmersive virtual reality (VR) and task-oriented circuit training on gait, balance, cognitive domains, and quality of life among the elderly population. Methods: This is a single-blind randomized control trial in which 28 elderly individuals between 60 and 75 years were selected. The participants were divided into two groups, task-oriented circuit training and the other receiving nonimmersive VR treatment, with 14 participants in each group. To analyze the effects of both training on balance and gait time up and go test (TUGT), dynamic gait index (DGI), measures were used and for cognitive domains Montreal cognitive assessment (MoCA) scale was used. Short form 12 (SF-12) (along with two domains, Physical Component Summary and Mental Component Summary) was used for the measurement of quality of life. The treatment duration was 8 weeks for both groups. Both the pre-test and post-test readings were analyzed and compared. Results: The mean age of participants was 66.91 +/- 3.79 years. Within-group comparison between the pre-test and post-test indicated that significant differences (P < 0.05) existed in all the outcome measures (TUGT, DGI, MoCA, and SF-12) in both groups. However, between-group comparison, significant differences were only found in TUGT and DGI in nonimmersive VR group. Conclusion: This study concluded that both interventions nonimmersive VR and task-oriented circuit training were beneficial for improving balance, gait, quality of life, and cognitive domains like memory, attention spans, executive functions, and so on in elderly population. However nonimmersive virtual reality training is a more effective, feasible, and safe alternative and can be proposed as a form of fall prevention exercise for the older adults.

[Title]    Virtual Reality Exergaming Capability to Change Muscle Strategy During the Limits of Stability Test and Reduce Fear of Falling in Primary Osteoporotic Women.
[Journal]  GAMES FOR HEALTH JOURNAL 12(4): 310-322.
[Abstract] Objective: Muscle strength and balance impairment change the control strategy and increase the probability of falling. This study aimed to investigate the effect of 6-week strength-balance training through virtual reality exergaming (VRE) on muscle strategy during the limits of stability (LOS) test, fear of falling, and quality of life (QOL) in osteoporotic women.Materials and Methods: Twenty volunteer postmenopausal women with osteoporosis were randomly allocated to the VRE (n = 10) and traditional training (TRT as control, n = 10) groups. The VRE and TRT strength-balance training was performed for 6 weeks and three sessions per week. Before and after exercise, the muscle activity (onset time, peak root means square [PRMS]) and hip/ankle activity ratio were assessed by the wireless electromyography system. The muscle activities of the dominant leg were recorded during LOS functional test. The fall efficacy scale and QOL were assessed. Paired t-test was used to compare results within groups, and an independent t-test was used to compare the percentage changes in parameters between the two groups.Results: The VRE improved the onset time and PRMS. The VRE significantly reduced the hip/ankle activity ratio in the LOS test's forward, backward, and right directions (P < 0.05). No significant change was seen in all directions of the LOS functional test in the TRT group (P > 0.05). VRE reduced the fall efficacy scale (P = 0.042). Both VRT and TRT improved the total QOL score (P = 0.010).Conclusion: VRE was more effective in decreasing the onset time and hip/ankle ratio of muscle activation. The VRE is recommended to induce a better ability to reduce the fear of falling and control balance during functional activity in osteoporotic women.Clinical Trial Registration number: IRCT20101017004952N9.

[Title]    The effect of virtual reality treadmill training on obstacle crossing parameters in older adults.
[Journal]  HUMAN MOVEMENT SCIENCE 96.
[Abstract] With increased age, walking without tripping requires greater cognitive demand. Therefore, it may be beneficial for training interventions to address and incorporate aspects of cognitive load. The purpose of this study was to compare a semi-immersive virtual reality treadmill training (VRTT) and conventional treadmill training (CTT) on obstacle clearance and trip hazard in older adults. Obstacle clearance parameters were measured with foot-mounted inertial measurement units (IMUs) and a Zeno pressure walkway. All data were processed and analyzed through custom Matlab scripts. Obstacle step height mean decreased (p = .003) in the lead limb following both training interventions. Additional significant changes were found in pre- and post-obstacle distance mean following both training interventions. Furthermore, significant correlations were found between demographic, cognitive, and functional mobility assessments and changes in dependent measures. The findings suggest that both the VRTT and CTT interventions may provide a reduction in trip risk in older adults, although through different methods.

[Title]    The Benefits of Custom Exergames for Fitness, Balance, and Health-Related Quality of Life: A Randomized Controlled Trial with Community-Dwelling Older Adults.
[Journal]  GAMES FOR HEALTH JOURNAL 10(4): 245-253.
[Abstract] Objective: This research aimed to measure the benefits in older adults' motor performance and quality of life during a 12-week-long multidimensional training combining custom-made exergames and traditional exercise in a complementary manner, compared with traditional training alone.Materials and Methods: Community-dwelling older adults participated in a randomized controlled trial (N = 31) consisting of two weekly exercise sessions of 60 minutes for 12 weeks. Participants allocated to the exergames group (n = 15) had one individual session of exergames and one traditional exercise group session per week. Control group participants (n = 16) had two weekly traditional exercise group sessions. Outcome measures on fitness, balance, and health-related quality of life were measured at the start of the intervention, 6th, 12th, and 16th week (1-month follow-up).Results: The exergames group showed a significant increase in lower-body and upper-body strength from pre- to postintervention. When compared with control, participants had significantly higher developments of upper-body strength from pre- to postassessments. There was a significant decrease in shoulder range of motion between the end of the intervention and follow-up for participants in both conditions. Balance increased significantly during the intervention but decreased at follow-up in both conditions. The mental component of health-related quality of life was significantly higher at the end compared with the start of the intervention in the exergames group, and this difference was significantly higher when compared with control.Conclusion: Integrating personalized exergames designed for multidimensional fitness training in traditional settings can be an effective strategy to enhance older adults' motor performance and mental well-being.

[Title]    Influence of the Use of Wii Games on Physical Frailty Components in Institutionalized Older Adults.
[Journal]  INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL RESEARCH AND PUBLIC HEALTH 18(5).
[Abstract] Aging is a multifactorial physiological phenomenon in which cellular and molecular changes occur. These changes lead to poor locomotion, poor balance, and an increased falling risk. This study aimed to determine the impact and effectiveness of the use of the Wii(R) game console on improving walking speed and balance, as well as its influence on frailty levels and falling risk, in older adults. A longitudinal study was designed with a pretest/post-test structure. The study population comprised people over 75 years of age who lived in a nursing home or attended a day care center (n = 80; 45 women; 84.2 +/- 8.7 years). Forty of them were included in the Wii group (20 rehabilitation sessions during 8 consecutive weeks), and the other 40 were in the control group. Falling risk and frailty were evaluated using the Downton scale and Fried scale; balance and walking speed were assessed with the Berg Balance scale and the Gait Speed Test, respectively, as well as the Short Physical Performance Battery (SPPB). The results showed that there was no significant association between Frailty Phenotype and study groups in baseline. However, there was significant association between Frailty Phenotype and study groups at the end of study. Moreover, a significantly higher and negative percentage change (Delta) in the Wii group with respect to the control group on the in falling risk (-20.05 +/- 35.14% vs. 7.92 +/- 24.53%) and in walking speed (-6.42 +/- 8.83% vs. -0.12 +/- 4.51%) during study, while there was a higher and positive significant percent change in static balance (6.07 +/- 5.74% vs. 2.13 +/- 4.64%) and on the SPPB (20.28 +/- 20.05% vs. 0.71 +/- 7.99%) after 8 weeks of study. The main conclusion of this study was that the use of the Wii(R) video console for 8 weeks positively influenced walking speed, falling risk, static balance, and frailty levels in older adults. Through a rehabilitation program with the Wii(R) game console in the older adults, frailty levels are reduced, accompanied by a reduction in falling risk and an increase in static balance and walking speed.

[Title]    ICT-based system to predict and prevent falls (iStoppFalls): results from an international multicenter randomized controlled trial.
[Journal]  EUROPEAN REVIEW OF AGING AND PHYSICAL ACTIVITY 12.
[Abstract] Background: Falls and fall-related injuries are a serious public health issue. Exercise programs can effectively reduce fall risk in older people. The iStoppFalls project developed an Information and Communication Technology-based system to deliver an unsupervised exercise program in older people's homes. The primary aims of the iStoppFalls randomized controlled trial were to assess the feasibility (exercise adherence, acceptability and safety) of the intervention program and its effectiveness on common fall risk factors.Methods: A total of 153 community-dwelling people aged 65+ years took part in this international, multicentre, randomized controlled trial. Intervention group participants conducted the exercise program for 16 weeks, with a recommended duration of 120 min/week for balance exergames and 60 min/week for strength exercises. All intervention and control participants received educational material including advice on a healthy lifestyle and fall prevention. Assessments included physical and cognitive tests, and questionnaires for health, fear of falling, number of falls, quality of life and psychosocial outcomes.Results: The median total exercise duration was 11.7 h (IQR = 22.0) over the 16-week intervention period. There were no adverse events. Physiological fall risk (Physiological Profile Assessment, PPA) reduced significantly more in the intervention group compared to the control group (F-1,(127)=4.54,p = 0.035). There was a significant three-way interaction for fall risk assessed by the PPA between the high-adherence (> 90 min/week; n = 18, 25.4 %), low-adherence (< 90 min/week; n = 53, 74.6 %) and control group (F-2,(125)=3.12, n = 75, p = 0.044). Post hoc analysis revealed a significantly larger effect in favour of the high-adherence group compared to the control group for fall risk (p = 0.031), postural sway (p = 0.046), stepping reaction time (p = 0.041), executive functioning (p = 0.044), and quality of life (p for trend = 0.052).Conclusions: The iStoppFalls exercise program reduced physiological fall risk in the study sample. Additional subgroup analyses revealed that intervention participants with better adherence also improved in postural sway, stepping reaction, and executive function.

[Title]    ICT-based system to predict and prevent falls (iStoppFalls): study protocol for an international multicenter randomized controlled trial.
[Journal]  BMC GERIATRICS 14.
[Abstract] Background: Falls are very common, especially in adults aged 65 years and older. Within the current international European Commission's Seventh Framework Program (FP7) project 'iStoppFalls' an Information and Communication Technology (ICT) based system has been developed to regularly assess a person's risk of falling in their own home and to deliver an individual and tailored home-based exercise and education program for fall prevention. The primary aims of iStoppFalls are to assess the feasibility and acceptability of the intervention program, and its effectiveness to improve balance, muscle strength and quality of life in older people.Methods/Design: This international, multicenter study is designed as a single-blinded, two-group randomized controlled trial. A total of 160 community-dwelling older people aged 65 years and older will be recruited in Germany (n = 60), Spain (n = 40), and Australia (n = 60) between November 2013 and May 2014. Participants in the intervention group will conduct a 16-week exercise program using the iStoppFalls system through their television set at home. Participants are encouraged to exercise for a total duration of 180 minutes per week. The training program consists of a variety of balance and strength exercises in the form of video games using exergame technology. Educational material about a healthy lifestyle will be provided to each participant. Final reassessments will be conducted after 16 weeks. The assessments include physical and cognitive tests as well as questionnaires assessing health, fear of falling, quality of life and psychosocial determinants. Falls will be followed up for six months by monthly falls calendars.Discussion: We hypothesize that the regular use of this newly developed ICT-based system for fall prevention at home is feasible for older people. By using the iStoppFalls sensor-based exercise program, older people are expected to improve in balance and strength outcomes. In addition, the exercise training may have a positive impact on quality of life by reducing the risk of falls. Taken together with expected cognitive improvements, the individual approach of the iStoppFalls program may provide an effective model for fall prevention in older people who prefer to exercise at home.

[Title]    The effect of sensor-based exercise at home on functional performance associated with fall risk in older people - a comparison of two exergame interventions.
[Journal]  EUROPEAN REVIEW OF AGING AND PHYSICAL ACTIVITY 12.
[Abstract] Background: There is good evidence that balance challenging exercises can reduce falls in older people. However, older people often find it difficult to incorporate such programs in their daily life. Videogame technology has been proposed to promote enjoyable, balance-challenging exercise. As part of a larger analysis, we compared feasibility and efficacy of two exergame interventions: step-mat-training (SMT) and Microsoft-Kinect (R) (KIN) exergames.Methods: 148 community-dwelling people, aged 65+ years participated in two exergame studies in Sydney, Australia (KIN: n = 57, SMT: n = 91). Both interventions were delivered as unsupervised exercise programs in participants' homes for 16 weeks. Assessment measures included overall physiological fall risk, muscle strength, finger-press reaction time, proprioception, vision, balance and executive functioning.Results: For participants allocated to the intervention arms, the median time played each week was 17 min (IQR 32) for KIN and 48 min (IQR 94) for SMT. Compared to the control group, SMT participants improved their fall risk score (p = 0.036), proprioception (p = 0.015), reaction time (p = 0.003), sit-to-stand performance (p = 0.011) and executive functioning (p = 0.001), while KIN participants improved their muscle strength (p = 0.032) and vision (p = 0.010), and showed a trend towards improved fall risk scores (p = 0.057).Conclusions: The findings suggest that it is feasible for older people to conduct an unsupervised exercise program at home using exergames. Both interventions reduced fall risk and SMT additionally improved specific cognitive functions. However, further refinement of the systems is required to improve adherence and maximise the benefits of exergames to deliver fall prevention programs in older people's homes.

[Title]    Effects of Exergames and Conventional Physical Therapy on Functional Physical Performance in Older Adults: A Randomized Controlled Trial.
[Journal]  GAMES FOR HEALTH JOURNAL 12(5): 341-349.
[Abstract] Objective: To evaluate the effects of exergames added to a conventional physical therapy (CPT) program on functional fitness and dynamometric muscle performance for the sit-to-stand (STS) maneuver in older adults and to compare their results concerning a CPT-only intervention.Materials and Methods: Fifty independent older adults were randomly assigned to CPT and exergames (CPT+ExG group; n = 25; age = 71.8 & PLUSMN; 6.8 years) or CPT alone (CPT group; n = 25; age = 71.3 & PLUSMN; 7.4 years). CPT was performed twice a week (60 min/session) for 8 weeks. The CPT+ExG group added exergames for 30 minutes in each session. The Senior Fitness Test was applied, considering the 30-second chair stand test as the primary outcome. Additionally, dynamometric muscle performance during the STS maneuver was assessed.Results: The CPT+ExG group improved the 30-second chair stand (lower body strength), back scratch (upper body flexibility), and 8-foot up-and-go (agility/dynamic balance) tests (all P < 0.05). Both groups improved the kinetic dynamometric variables peak force, peak power, and total work (all P < 0.05). Also, both groups improved the 30-second arm curl test (upper body strength) (P < 0.05), although the increase was higher in the CPT+ExG group compared with the CPT group (time x group; P < 0.05).Conclusion: Adding exergames to a CPT program only significantly increases upper limb strength compared with CPT alone. The findings of this study have implications for the design of future exergame interventions focused on improving STS maneuver performance in older adults.

[Title]    Effectiveness and sustainability of a motor-cognitive stepping exergame training on stepping performance in older adults: a randomized controlled trial.
[Journal]  EUROPEAN REVIEW OF AGING AND PHYSICAL ACTIVITY 17(1).
[Abstract] Background: Training effects reported for stepping exergames on stepping performances in older adults often based on not comprehensively validated outcomes measures, and follow-up data on their sustainability are lacking. The aim of this study is to evaluate the effectiveness and sustainability of a motor-cognitive stepping exergame training on the stepping performance in older adults.Methods: Fifty-eight older adults (78.3 +/- 6.5 years) participated in the randomized controlled trial with a 10-week intervention and 10-week follow-up period. The intervention group (IG:n = 29) took part in a once-weekly exercise program including strength and balance exercises supplemented with an additional stepping exergame training. The control group (CG:n = 29) only performed the strength and balance exercises. Outcome measures included stepping reaction times (SRTs) and games scores for individual stepping exergame levels and for the overall exergame performance, as measured by an assessment strategy previously validated in older adults.Results: SRTs and/or games scores for 7 out of 10 levels and the overall exergame performance significantly improved in the IG compared to the CG during the intervention (p <= 0.001-0.039, eta(2)(p) = 0.090-0.445). Training gains were sustained for 2 levels and for the overall exergame performance (p = 0.017-0.033, eta(2)(p) = 0.127-0.193).Conclusion: The study demonstrates that the additional stepping exergame training effectively and sustainably improves the performance in complex motor-cognitive stepping exergame tasks in older adults, which can be relevant for preventing falls. Future research is needed to evaluate the effectiveness of such training on reducing the number of falls.

[Title]    Virtual reality system based on Kinect for the elderly in fall prevention.
[Journal]  TECHNOLOGY AND HEALTH CARE 22(1): 27-36.
[Abstract] BACKGROUND: Daily life movements require balance ability. Good balance control is closely related to body stability and its development. Therefore, balance training is necessary for any age group.OBJECTIVE: This study proposes the combination of Kinect and virtual reality to build an information platform of interactive scenarios, for practice and evaluation of balance ability. Real-time monitoring of SpO(2), pulse rate, velocity and reaction time during the training process is presented for the training activities of elderly physical function.METHODS: Based on the indicators of balance ability, this information platform sets out various training activities to improve balance ability, making the supposedly tedious process fun and vivid and leading to much better training results.RESULTS: The data (SpO(2), pulse rate, velocity, reaction time) collected from this platform can be sorted and analysed, and the results used to evaluate the performance of balance training, and referenced for follow-up planning in the future. The real-time pulse rate and SpO(2) measurement information indicating the training activities for the elderly to maintain physical function has a positive significance. A noninvasive and unconstrained real-time method to detect the pulse rate and SpO(2) during exercises is presented. The results of balance assessment scale testing of BBS and TUG for the experimental group show that effective balance really improved. The difference between the experimental group and the control group was achieved by using paired t-test. The data were analysed by the descriptive statistics on significant level of P < 0.01.CONCLUSIONS: From the training results of the participants, we know that the information platform developed for enhancing balance ability is in line with practical needs. Furthermore, the fun and interesting game-like exercises it introduces are very helpful in improving balance ability, and certainly in preventing falls.

[Title]    Effects of physical, virtual reality-based, and brain exercise on physical, cognition, and preference in older persons: a randomized controlled trial.
[Journal]  EUROPEAN REVIEW OF AGING AND PHYSICAL ACTIVITY 15.
[Abstract] Background: Physical exercise (PE), virtual reality-based exercise (VRE), and brain exercise (BE) can influence physical and cognitive conditions in older persons. However, it is not known which of the three types of exercises provide the best effects on physical and cognitive status, and which exercise is preferred by older persons. This study compared the effects of PE, VRE, and BE on balance, muscle strength, cognition, and fall concern. In addition, exercise effort perception and contentment in older persons was evaluated.Methods: Eighty-four older persons (n = 84) were randomly selected for PE, VRE, BE, and control groups. The exercise groups received 8-week training, whereas the control group did not. Balance was assessed by Berg Balance Scale (BBS) and Timed Up and Go test (TUG), muscle strength by 5 Times Sit to Stand (5TSTS) and left and right hand grip strength (HGS), cognition by Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MoCA) and Timed Up and Go test Cognition (TUG-cog), fall concern by Fall Efficacy Scale International (FES-I), exercise effort perception by Borg category ratio scale (Borg CR-10), and exercise contentment by a questionnaire.Results: After exercise, PE significantly enhanced TUG and 5TSTS to a greater extent than VRE (TUG; p = 0.004, 5TSTS; p = 0.027) and BE (TUG; p = 0,012, 5TSTS; p < 0.001). VRE significantly improved MoCA (p < 0.001) and FES-I (p = 0.036) compared to PE, and 5TSTS (p < 0.001) and FES-I (p = 0.011) were improved relative to BE. MoCA was significantly enhanced by BE compared to PE (p < 0.001) and both MoCA and TUG-cog were improved compared to VRE (p = 0.04). PE and VRE significantly (p < 0.001) increased Borg CR-10 in all exercise sessions, whereas BE showed a significant improvement (p < 0.001) in the first 4 sessions. Participants had a significantly greater satisfaction with BE than controls (p = 0.006), and enjoyed VRE and BE more than PE (p < 0.001). Subjects in all exercise groups exhibited benefits compared to the control group (p < 0.001).Conclusions: PE provided the best results in physical tests, VRE produced measurable improvements in physical and cognition scores, while BE enhanced cognition ability in older persons. Older persons preferred VRE and BE compared to PE. Both exercises are suggested to older persons to improve physical and cognitive conditions.

[Title]    Block and Random Practice: A Wii Fit Dynamic Balance Training in Older Adults.
[Journal]  RESEARCH QUARTERLY FOR EXERCISE AND SPORT 92(3): 352-360.
[Abstract] Purpose: To compare the effectiveness of blocked and random practice schedules of balance training in dynamic balance abilities of older adults using Wii Fit balance game tasks. Method: Forty-one participants who were not receiving hospice care or living in a nursing home participated. Three Wii Fit balance tasks (tasks A, B, and C) were selected for training, and one task (task D) was selected as the transfer test among the nine tasks in the Wii Fit balance game software. Scores for tasks A and D were evaluated. Completion times for tasks B and C were evaluated. Moved distance for the functional reach test (FRT), completion time for the timed up and go test (TUG), and performance score for the Tinetti performance-oriented mobility assessment (POMA) were also tested as clinical balance assessment outcomes. Results: The training significantly improved the performance outcomes of clinical balance assessments and task D. There were no significant group x time interaction effects and no significant main effects by group during the acquisition and retention periods of tasks A, B, and C. However, significant main effects by time were observed for tasks A, B, and C. Conclusions: When dynamic balance training such as the Wii Fit balance system is administered to older adults in a clinical setting, either a block or a random practice schedule can be effectively used to improve the dynamic balance skills. Wii Fit-based balance training is clinically effective for improving the dynamic balance ability.

[Title]    Study protocol: effect of playful training on functional abilities of older adults - a randomized controlled trial.
[Journal]  BMC GERIATRICS 17.
[Abstract] Background: Loss of functional capabilities due to inactivity is one of the most common reasons for fall accidents, and it has been well established that loss of capabilities can be effectively reduced by physical activity. Pilot studies indicate a possible improvement in functional abilities of community dwelling elderly as a result of short-term playing with an exergame system in the form of interactive modular tiles. Such playful training may be motivational to perform and viewed by the subjects to offer life-fulfilling quality, while providing improvement in physical abilities, e.g. related to prevent fall accidents. The RCT will test for a variety of health parameters of community-dwelling elderly playing on interactive modular tiles.Methods: The study will be a single blinded, randomized controlled trial with 60 community-dwelling adults 70+ years. The trial will consist an intervention group of 30 participants training with the interactive modular tiles, and a control group of 30 participants that will receive the usual care provided to non-patient elderly. The intervention period will be 12 weeks. The intervention group will perform group training (4-5 individuals for 1 h training session with each participant receiving 13 min training) on the interactive tiles twice a week. Follow-up tests include 6-min Walk Test (6MWT), the 8-ft Timed Up & Go Test (TUG), and the Chair-Stand Test (CS) from the Senior Fitness Test, along with balancing tests (static test on Wii Board and Line Walk test). Secondary outcomes related to adherence, motivation and acceptability will be investigated through semi-structured interviews. Data will be collected from pre-and post-tests. Data will be analyzed for statistically significant differences by checking that there is a Gaussian distribution and then using paired t-test, otherwise using Wilcoxon signed-rank test. "Intention to treat" analysis will be done.Discussion: The trial tests for increased mobility, agility, balancing and general fitness of community-dwelling elderly as a result of playing, in this case on modular interactive tiles. A positive outcome may help preventing loss of functional capabilities due to inactivity.

[Title]    The effectiveness of virtual reality training in reducing the risk of falls among elderly people.
[Journal]  CLINICAL INTERVENTIONS IN AGING 13: 2329-2338.
[Abstract] Background: Virtual reality (VR) training using modem game consoles is an innovative rehabilitation method for fall-prone elderly people. The aim of this study was to assess the effectiveness of VR training using the "Xbox 360 Kinect" in people over 60 years of age.Materials and methods: The study involved 23 people, including 19 women and 4 men (mean age 75.74 +/- 8.09 years). The following functional tests were employed as research instruments: the 6-minute walking test (6MWT), the Dynamic Gait Index (DGI), the tandem stance test (TST), the tandem walk test (TWT), and the Beck Depression Inventory (BDI). A "spring hand dynamometer" was also used. The participants underwent 30-day VR training using an Xbox 360 Kinect. They trained 3 times a week, with each exercise lasting 30 minutes.Results: The 6MWT (P<0.001), the DGI (P=0.008), the TST (P<0.001), the TWT (P=0.002), and the BDI (P<0.001) outcomes were significantly improved. There were differences in the results for the strength of the "pressing muscles" in the right (P=0.106) and left (P=0.043) hands of the participants. Both participants under 80 years of age and those aged 80 years and over had visibly better results on the 6MWT (P<0.001 and P=0.008, respectively), the TST (P<0.001 and P=0.008, respectively), and the BDI (P=0.003 and P=0.012, respectively).Condusion: Training based on VR increases the possibilities of motor training and can help reduce the risk of falls by improving the static and dynamic balance.

[Title]    Gaming-Based Tele-Exercise Program to Improve Physical Function in Frail Older Adults: Feasibility Randomized Controlled Trial.
[Journal]  JOURNAL OF MEDICAL INTERNET RESEARCH 26: e56810-e56810.
[Abstract] BACKGROUND: Frailty leads to reduced physical activity can cause increased fall risk. This contributes to accelerated aging processes, leading to adverse health outcomes and reduced quality of life. We have developed and piloted the design, usability, safety, and feasibility of a gaming-based cognitive-motor (CogXergaming) tele-exercise protocol in prefrail older adults.OBJECTIVE: This pilot randomized control trial tested preliminary feasibility and effectiveness of the CogXergaming telehealth protocol for improving physical function.METHODS: Community-dwelling, prefrail older adults were randomly assigned to CogXergaming (n=13) or a control group (n=14). The CogXergaming group received supervised tele-exercises in a gaming format for 6 weeks (3 sessions per week) comprising 18 sessions lasting 90 minutes each. Control group participants participated in a Matter of Balance (MOB), an 8-week, once-a-week structured 90-minute tele-session that has been shown to reduce the fear of falling and increase physical activity. Feasibility of training was obtained by computing the median duration of training sessions for the CogXergaming group. Effectiveness was assessed using dynamic balance control (Four Square Step Test), subjective self-efficacy (Activities-Specific Balance Confidence scale), gait function (Tinetti Performance Oriented Mobility Assessment), muscle strength (30-second chair stand test), and endurance (2-minute step in-place test).RESULTS: Of the 45 participants enrolled in the study, 4 participants from CogXergaming group and 5 from MOB group lost contact after signing the consent form and did not receive their respective intervention. Eighteen participants were randomized to each group. In the CogXergaming group, 15 (83%) completed the intervention, with 3 (16%) dropping out in the first week. In the MOB group, 16 (88%) completed the program, with 2 (11%) withdrawing during the first week. In addition, there was a significant time group interaction for Four Square Step Test (F1,21=5.55, P=.03), Tinetti Performance Oriented Mobility Assessment (F1,25=4.16, P=.05), and 30-second chair stand test (F1,21=5.06, P=.03), with a significant improvement in these measures for the CogXergaming group post training, compared with no change observed in the MOB group.CONCLUSIONS: These pilot findings indicate that CogXergaming is feasible and applicable in prefrail older adults. Such game-based protocols can be beneficial in improving physical function among community-dwelling, prefrail older adults, however, the efficacy of such training requires further investigation.TRIAL REGISTRATION: ClinicalTrials.gov NCT04534686; https://clinicaltrials.gov/study/NCT04534686.

[Title]    Cognitive-motor exergaming for reducing fall risk in people with chronic stroke: A randomized controlled trial.
[Journal]  NEUROREHABILITATION 44(4): 493-510.
[Abstract] BACKGROUND: Dual-task (simultaneous motor and cognitive task) (DT) training via virtual-reality exergaming is known to benefit balance control post-stroke. However, the efficacy of such training on DT balance control (volitional and reactive) and cognitive (executive function and attention) domains associated with fall risk remains unclear.OBJECTIVE: We evaluated the efficacy of cognitive-motor exergame training (CMT) (Wii-fit games in conjunction with cognitive tasks) for improving balance control (volitional and reactive) and cognition (executive function and attention) among people with chronic stroke (PwCS).METHODS: Hemiparetic, ambulatory PwCS were randomly assigned to either CMT (n = 12) or conventional training (CT) (n = 12) and underwent six weeks of high-intensity, tapered balance training. The CMT group performed Wii-fit games in conjunction with cognitive tasks, while CT group underwent customized, progressive balance training. Performance under DT conditions on Limits of Stability (volitional) and Slip-Perturbation (reactive) tests, and letter-number sequencing (cognition) determined the efficacy of CMT.RESULTS: Post-intervention, under DT reactive conditions, CMT group improved both motor and cognition, while the CT group improved motor alone. Under DT volitional conditions, motor performance improved only in CMT group.CONCLUSION: Cognitive-motor exergaming appears to be effective for improving balance control and cognition and could be implemented in clinical stroke rehabilitation settings.

[Title]    Effect of interactive cognitive motor training on gait and balance among older adults: A randomized controlled trial.
[Journal]  INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF NURSING STUDIES 82: 121-128.
[Abstract] Background: Aging is a normal degenerative process that results in a decline in the gait and balance performance of older adults. Interactive cognitive motor training is an intervention that integrates cognitive and motor tasks to promote individuals' physical and cognitive fall risk factors. However, the additive effects of the interactive cognitive motor training on objective quantitative data and comprehensive descriptions of gait and balance warrants further investigation.Objectives: To investigate the effect of interactive cognitive motor training on older adults' gait and balance from immediate to long-term time points.Design: A double-blind randomized control trial.Settings: Four senior service centers and community service centers in Taiwan.Participants: 62 older adults who met the inclusion criteria.Methods: The study participants were older adults without cognitive impairment, and they were randomly allocated to the experimental group or active control group. In both groups, older adults participated in three sessions of 30-min training per week for a total of 8 weeks, with the total number of training sessions being 24. The primary outcome was gait performance, which was measured using objective and subjective indicators. iWALK was used as an objective indicator to measure pace and dynamic stability; the Functional Gait Assessment was employed as a subjective indicator. The secondary outcome was balance performance, which was measured using iSWAY. A generalized estimating equation was used to identify whether the results of the two groups differ after receiving different intervention measures; the results were obtained from immediate to long-term posttests.Results: Stride length in the pace category of the experimental group improved significantly in immediate posttest (p = 0.01), 3-month follow-up (p = 0.01), and 6-month follow-up (p = 0.04). The range of motion of the leg exhibited significant improvement in immediate posttest (p = 0.04) and 3-month follow-up (p = 0.04). The Functional Gait Assessment result indicated that statistically significant improvement was observed in immediate posttest (p = 0.02) and 12-month follow-up (p = 0.01). The results of balance performance showed that the experimental group attained statistically significant improvement in centroid frequency in the immediate posttest (p = 0.02).Conclusions: The research results validated that the 24 sessions of the interactive cognitive motor training intervention significantly improved gait and balance performance. Future studies should extend the sample to communities to promote the gait and balance performance of community-dwelling older adults without cognitive impairment and reduce their risk of falling and developing gait-related diseases.

[Title]    The effect of adding exergame boxing to balance functions of elderly women.
[Journal]  BALI MEDICAL JOURNAL 12(3): 2642-2645.
[Abstract] Background: The average incidence of falls in elderly women exceeds that of elderly men in all age groups. Exercise had a consistent effect on reducing the risk of falls when prescribed correctly and was successful in reducing fall rates in the community, with an even greater effect seen in a balance-challenging exercise program. The exercise in question is a series of combined activities that maintain or increase flexibility, endurance, strength and balance. Compared to traditional sports, sports games are more interesting and challenging, are not affected by the weather, and being able to practice at home increases safety and comfort. Exergame boxing is considered a fun and competitive fighting video game, so it has an effect on psychological and social interactions in the elderly. The aim of this study was to evaluate the effect of adding exergame boxing on the balance function of elderly women.Methods: This study is a true experimental research with pre and post-test randomized control group design. The research participants were 32 elderly women, with each group consisting of 16 elderly women. Participants in the treatment group received exergame boxing, which was carried out 3 times per week for 8 weeks. Participants in both groups are required to take part in conventional exercises programmed by Nursing Home 5x/week for +/- 15 minutes. The outputs were assessed at the beginning (initial value) and after 8 weeks of intervention (final value).Results: There were significantly significant differences in the One Leg Stance (OLS) and Timed Up and Go (TUG) values in the control and treatment group (p<0.005), but the effect size was higher in the treatment group.Conclusions: The addition of exercise boxing for 8 weeks can improve the static and dynamic balance function of elderly women as measured by OLS and TUG.

[Title]    EFFECTS OF VIRTUAL REALITY EXERGAME ON PSYCHOPHYSIOLOGICAL AND POSTURAL DISORDERS IN ELDERLY PATIENTS.
[Journal]  BULLETIN OF RUSSIAN STATE MEDICAL UNIVERSITY(6): 46-53.
[Abstract] Balance impairment at advanced age is a serious medical problem that often has significant implications and affects the quality of the patient's life. Among the underlying causes are overall slowness of motor response and vestibular syndrome. Virtual reality exergames, including reaction and balance training, hold promise for managing balance dysfunction. The aim of this study was to investigate the effects of a combination rehabilitation program containing elements of virtual reality exergame on the postural and psychophysiological parameters of elderly patients with small vascular disease The study was conducted in 24 patients with small vascular disease (median age: 66 years). All patients underwent a virtual reality rehabilitation program. Psychophysiological, postural and clinical evaluations were performed at baseline and after the program was completed. Balance function measured on the Berg scale improved significantly and was 53 [52; 55] after the training program vs 50 [45; 54] at baseline (p < 0.05). The strategy of balance control also changed: the Romberg ratio was 266 [199.5; 478.5] before rehabilitation and 221 [149.25; 404] after the program was completed (p < 0.05). The most pronounced changes in the measured psychophysiological parameters occurred in the simple audiomotor reaction, which improved from 210 [174.25; 245.5] at baseline to 180.5 [170.5; 208] after rehabilitation (p < 0.05). Thus, the combination balance and reaction virtual reality training is an effective rehabilitation method for advanced-age patients with balance impairment.
[Answer]   YES
[Response] YES. The paper meets the criteria for being about the use of exergames to prevent falls in the elderly:
1. The intervention targets older people (median age: 66 years).
2. The intervention is a virtual reality exergame, which includes reaction and balance training.

[Title]    Dual Motor-Cognitive Virtual Reality Training Impacts Dual-Task Performance in Freezing of Gait.
[Journal]  IEEE JOURNAL OF BIOMEDICAL AND HEALTH INFORMATICS 19(6): 1855-1861.
[Abstract] Freezing of gait (FOG), an episodic gait disturbance characterized by the inability to generate effective stepping, occurs in more than half of Parkinson's disease patients. It is associated with both executive dysfunction and attention and becomes most evident during dual tasking (performing two tasks simultaneously). This study examined the effect of dual motor-cognitive virtual reality training on dual-task performance in FOG. Twenty community dwelling participants with Parkinson's disease (13 with FOG, 7 without FOG) participated in a pre-assessment, eight 20-minute intervention sessions, and a post-assessment. The intervention consisted of a virtual reality maze (DFKI, Germany) through which participants navigated by stepping-in-place on a balance board (Nintendo, Japan) under time pressure. This was combined with a cognitive task (Stroop test), which repeatedly divided participants' attention. The primary outcome measures were pre-and post-intervention differences in motor (stepping time, symmetry, rhythmicity) and cognitive (accuracy, reaction time) performance during single-and dual-tasks. Both assessments consisted of 1) a single cognitive task 2) a single motor task, and 3) a dual motorcognitive task. Following the intervention, there was significant improvement in dual-task cognitive and motor parameters (stepping time and rhythmicity), dual-task effect for those with FOG and a noteworthy improvement in FOG episodes. These improvements were less significant for those without FOG. This is the first study to show benefit of a dual motor-cognitive approach on dual-task performance in FOG. Advances in such virtual reality interventions for home use could substantially improve the quality of life for patients who experience FOG.
[Answer]   YES
[Response] YES. The paper meets the criteria for being about the use of exergames to prevent falls in the elderly:. 1. Intervention Targets: The study includes older people, specifically community-dwelling participants with Parkinson's disease, which is a condition that often affects older adults.
2. Intervention Type: The intervention involves a virtual reality (VR) maze and a balance board, which are forms of exergames.
3. Study Design: The study reports on a randomized controlled trial, with pre- and post-intervention assessments.
4. Original Data: The paper presents original data from the trial, including specific outcome measures and results.. Therefore, the paper is about the use of exergames to improve dual-task performance, which can help prevent falls in the elderly.

[Title]    Benefits of Virtual Reality Program and Motor Imagery Training on Balance and Fall Efficacy in Isolated Older Adults: A Randomized Controlled Trial.
[Journal]  MEDICINA-LITHUANIA 58(11).
[Abstract] Background and Objectives: for isolated older adults, alternative training indoors to maintain balance is essential; however, related studies are lacking. To improve the balance of isolated older adults and reduce their fear of falling, we aimed to examine the balance-keeping effect of a virtual reality (VR) program and motor imagery training (MIT) and propose training that could improve physical activity among older adults. Methods: a total of 34 older adults admitted to a convalescent hospital were assessed. VR (n = 12) and MIT (n = 10) groups completed their assigned intervention in six weeks, whereas the control group (CG) (n = 12) did not. The follow-up was performed after two weeks. Results: in group x time interactions, body center movement area, open and closed eyes balance scores, and fall efficacy were significantly different (p < 0.05). In contrast with the VR group, the MIT group did not show a significant difference in the open or closed eyes balance scores depending on the period. However, there was a significant difference between the MIT group and CG in the open eyes balance score post-test (d = 1.13, 95% confidence interval, 0.40-12.33). Conclusions: we propose VR and MIT as training methods to prevent physical weakness in isolated older adults.
[Answer]   YES

[Title]    Virtual Reality Programs and Motor Imagery Training Reduce Plantar Pressure and Depression in Isolated Older Adults.
[Journal]  INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF GERONTOLOGY 16(2): 100-105.
[Abstract] Background: The purpose of this study was to measure the level of plantar pressure and depression in isolated older adults. We also proposed virtual reality program (VR) and motor imagery training (MIT) as interventions to prevent falls. Methods: This study was conducted with 34 healthy older individuals admitted to a convalescent hospital. The participants were divided into three groups: virtual reality group (VRG), motor imagery training group (MIG), and control group (CG). The evaluation period was six weeks, after which an eightweek follow-up study was conducted. The Gaitview (R) AFA-50 system was used to measure the difference in the ratio between static plantar pressure and dynamic plantar pressure. The degree of depression was measured using the Geriatric Depression Scale. Result: In the interaction between the group and period, there were significant differences in the left and right (L/R) static plantar pressure (p = .044), anterior and posterior (A/P) static plantar pressure (p = .000), L/R dynamic plantar pressure (p = .008), A/P dynamic plantar pressure (p = .031), and depression (p = .000). Unlike the VRG, there was no significant difference in the MIG in the comparison between the L/R static plantar pressure pre-test and post-test in time. However, compared to the post-test, follow-up showed significant results (d =-0.9, 95% CI, -1.8 to -0.1), confirming the positive effect (p < .05). Conclusion: VR and MIT are effective in improving balance and depression in older individuals isolated from convalescent hospitals. Therefore, VR and MIT are recommended as alternatives to physical activity for isolated older individuals.

[Title]    Training older adults with virtual reality use to improve collision-avoidance behavior when walking through an aperture.
[Journal]  ARCHIVES OF GERONTOLOGY AND GERIATRICS 92.
[Abstract] Many older adults perform collision-avoidance behavior either insufficiently (i.e., frequent collision) or inefficiently (i.e., exaggerated behavior to ensure collision-avoidance). The present study examined whether a training system using virtual reality (VR) simulation enhanced older adults' collision-avoidance behavior in response to a VR image of an aperture during real walking. Twenty-five (n =13 intervention group and n =12 control group) older individuals participated. During training, a VR image of walking through an aperture was projected onto a large screen. Participants in the intervention group tried to avoid virtual collision with the minimum body rotation required to walk on the spot through a variety of narrow apertures. Participants in the control group remained without body rotation while walking on the spot through a wide aperture. A comparison between pretest and post-test performances in the real environment indicated that after the training, significantly smaller body rotation angles were observed in the intervention group. This suggests that the training led participants to modify their behavior to try to move efficiently during real walking. However, although not significant, collision rates also tended to be greater, suggesting that, at least for some participants, the modification required to avoid collision was too difficult. Transfer of the learned behavior using the VR environment to real walking is discussed.
[Answer]   YES
[Response] YES. The paper meets the criteria for being about the use of exergames to prevent falls in the elderly:. 1. Intervention Targets: The study involves older adults.
2. Intervention: The intervention uses a virtual reality (VR) simulation, which is a form of exergame.
3. Randomized Controlled Trial: The study includes a randomized controlled trial with an intervention group and a control group, and the results are reported.

[Title]    Three-Dimensional Augmented Reality System for Balance and Mobility Rehabilitation in the Elderly: A Randomized Controlled Trial.
[Journal]  CYBERPSYCHOLOGY BEHAVIOR AND SOCIAL NETWORKING 22(2): 132-141.
[Abstract] We attempted to evaluate the clinical efficiency of a novel three-dimensional interactive augmented reality system (3D-ARS) for balance and mobility rehabilitation. This system enables participant training with a realistic 3D interactive balance exercise and assessing movement parameters and joint angles by using a kinetic sensor system. We performed a randomized controlled trial in a general hospital. Thirty-six participants (age, 56-76 years) who could independently walk and stand on one leg were recruited. The participants were randomly assigned to either group. The control group (n = 18) underwent a conventional physical fitness program such as lower-extremity strengthening and balance training thrice per week for 1 month. The experimental group (n = 18) experienced 3D-ARS training thrice per week (1 session = 30 minutes) for 4 weeks. Training comprised a balloon game for hip exercise, cave game for knee exercise, and rhythm game for one-leg balance exercise. Lower-extremity clinical scale scores, fall index, and automatic balance score were measured by using Tetrax (R) posturography before, during, and after training. Significant group (3D-ARS vs. control) x time (before and after exercise) interaction effect was observed for Berg balance scale (BBS) scores (p = 0.04) and timed-up-and-go (TUG; p < 0.001). Overall improvements occurred in stability index, weight distribution index, fall risk index, and Fourier transformations index of posturography for both groups. However, score changes were significantly greater in the 3D-ARS group. Significant group x time interaction effect was observed for the fall risk index. This demonstrates that the 3D-ARS system can improve balance in the elderly more effectively.
[Answer]   YES
[Response] YES. The paper meets all the specified criteria:
1. The intervention targets older people, with participants aged 56-76 years.
2. The intervention is a three-dimensional interactive augmented reality system (3D-ARS), which falls under the category of exergames.
3. The study is a randomized controlled trial, and the results are reported.
4. The paper is not a meta-analysis, review, or feasibility analysis; it presents original data from a randomized controlled trial.

[Title]    Effects of a Rehabilitation Program Using a Patient-Personalized Exergame on Fear of Falling and Risk of Falls in Vulnerable Older Adults: Protocol for a Randomized Controlled Group Study.
[Journal]  JMIR RESEARCH PROTOCOLS 10(8).
[Abstract] Background: Older adults often experience physical, sensory, and cognitive decline. Therefore, they have a high risk of falls, which leads to severe health and psychological consequences and can induce fear of falling. Rehabilitation programs using exergames to prevent falls are being increasingly studied. Medimoov is a movement-based patient-personalized exergame for rehabilitation in older adults. A preliminary study showed that its use may influence functional ability and motivation. Most existing studies that evaluate the use of exergames do not involve an appropriate control group and do not focus on patient-personalized exergames.Objective: This study aims to evaluate the effects of Medimoov on risk of falls and fear of falling in older adults compared with standard psychomotor rehabilitation.Methods: This is a serial, comparative, randomized controlled group study. Both groups (n=25 in each) will receive psychomotor rehabilitation care. However, the methods of delivery will be different; one group will be exposed to the Medimoov exergame platform, and the other only to traditional means of psychomotor rehabilitation. The selection criteria will be (1) age of 65 years or older, (2) ability to answer a questionnaire, (3) ability to stand in a bipedal position for at least 1 minute, (4) score of 13 or greater on the Short Fall Efficacy Scale, and (5) stable medical condition. An evaluation will be made prior to starting the intervention, after 4 weeks of intervention, and at the end of the intervention (after 8 weeks), and it will focus on (1) risk of falls, (2) fear of falling, and (3) cognitive evaluations. Physical activity outside the session will also be assessed by actimetry. The outcome assessment will be performed according to intention-to-treat analysis.Results: The protocol (2019-11-22) has been approved by the Comite de Protection des Personnes Nord-Ouest I-Universite de Rouen (2019-A00395-52), which is part of the French national ethical committee. The study received funding in February 2020. As of October 2020 (submission date), and due to the context of the COVID-19 pandemic, a total of 10 participants out of 50 had been enrolled in the study. The projected date for the end of the data collection is December 2021. Data analyses have not been started yet, and publication of the results is expected for Spring 2022.Conclusions: The effects of psychomotor rehabilitation using the Medimoov exergame platform on the risk and fear of falls will be evaluated. This pilot study will be the basis for larger trials.
[Answer]   YES
[Response] UNCERTAIN. The paper describes a protocol for a randomized controlled trial that aims to evaluate the effects of a patient-personalized exergame (Medimoov) on the risk of falls and fear of falling in older adults. The intervention targets older people, and the intervention is an exergame. However, the abstract indicates that the study is still in progress, and the results have not been reported yet. Therefore, it does not meet the criteria of having the results reported, which is necessary for a "YES" answer.

[Title]    Virtual Reality Gait Training to Promote Balance and Gait Among Older People: A Randomized Clinical Trial.
[Journal]  GERIATRICS 6(1).
[Abstract] Falls are the leading cause of injury and injury-related death in the elderly. This study evaluated the effect of virtual reality gait training (VRGT) with non-motorized treadmill on balance and gait ability of elderly individuals who had experienced a fall. Fifty-six elderly individuals living in local communities participated in this study. Subjects who met the selection criteria were randomly divided into a VRGT group (n = 28) and a control group (n = 28). The VRGT group received VRGT with non-motorized treadmill for 50 min a day for 4 weeks and 5 days a week. The control group received non-motorized treadmill gait training without virtual reality for the same amount of time as the VRGT group. Before and after the training, the one-leg-standing test, Berg Balance Scale, Functional Reach test, and Timed Up and Go test were used to assess balance ability, and the gait analyzer system was used to evaluate the improvement in gait spatiotemporal parameters. In the VRGT group, the balance ability variable showed a significant decrease in the one-leg-standing test and a significant improvement in the Timed Up and Go test. With respect to spatiotemporal gait parameters, velocity and step width decreased significantly in the VRGT group (p < 0.05), and stride length and step length were significantly improved in the VRGT group (p < 0.05). VRGT with nonmotorized treadmill has been shown to improve balance and gait ability in the elderly. This study is expected to provide basic data on exercise programs for the elderly to prevent falls.
[Answer]   YES

[Title]    Home-Based Exergame Program to Improve Physical Function, Fall Efficacy, Depression and Quality of Life in Community-Dwelling Older Adults: A Randomized Controlled Trial.
[Journal]  HEALTHCARE 11(8).
[Abstract] This study aimed to investigate the effects of home-based exergame programs on physical function, fall efficacy, depression, and health-related quality of life in community-dwelling older adults. Fifty-seven participants aged 75 years or older were divided into control and experimental groups. The experimental group received a home-based exergame program that included balance and lower-extremity muscle strength for 8 weeks. The participants exercised at home for 50 min three times a week and were monitored through a video-conference application. Both groups received online education on musculoskeletal health once a week, whereas the control group did not exercise. Physical function was assessed using the one-leg standing test (OLST), Berg balance scale (BBS), functional reaching test (FRT), timed up-and-go test (TUGT), and five-times sit-to-stand (FTSTS). Fall efficacy was assessed using the modified falls efficacy scale (MFES). Depression was assessed using the geriatric depression scale (GDS). Health-related quality of life was assessed using a 36-item short-form health survey (SF-36). The experimental group showed an overall improvement in OLST, BBS, FRT, TUGT, and FTSTS (p < 0.05). MFES was significantly increased in the experimental group after the intervention (p < 0.05). The GDS significantly decreased in the experimental group after the intervention (p < 0.05). In SF-36, role limitations due to physical health, general health, and fatigue (energy and fatigue) items improved in the experimental group after intervention (p < 0.05). An 8-week home-based exergame program improved physical function, fall efficacy, depression, and health-related quality of life in older adults. The study was registered on ClinicalTrials.gov (NCT05802537).

[Title]    Virtual Reality Training With Three-Dimensional Video Games Improves Postural Balance and Lower Extremity Strength in Community-Dwelling Older Adults.
[Journal]  JOURNAL OF AGING AND PHYSICAL ACTIVITY 25(4): 621-627.
[Abstract] Avatar-based three-dimensional technology is a new approach to improve physical function in older adults. The aim of this study was to use three-dimensional video gaming technology in virtual reality training to improve postural balance and lower extremity strength in a population of community-dwelling older adults. The experimental group participated in the virtual reality training program for 60 min, twice a week, for 6 weeks. Both experimental and control groups were given three times for falls prevention education at the first, third, and fifth weeks. The experimental group showed significant improvements not only in static and dynamic postural balance but also lower extremity strength (p < .05). Furthermore, the experimental group was improved to overall parameters compared with the control group (p < .05). Therefore, three-dimensional video gaming technology might be beneficial for improving postural balance and lower extremity strength in community-dwelling older adults.

[Title]    Fear of falling: efficacy of virtual reality associated with serious games in elderly people.
[Journal]  NEUROPSYCHIATRIC DISEASE AND TREATMENT 12: 877-881.
[Abstract] Objective: Fear of falling is defined as an ongoing concern about falling that is not explained by physical examination. Focusing on the psychological dimension of this pathology (phobic reaction to walking), we looked at how virtual reality associated with serious games can be used to treat this pathology.Methods: Participants with fear of falling were randomly assigned to either a treatment group or a waiting list. The therapy consisted of 12 weekly sessions of virtual reality exposure therapy associated with serious games.Results: Sixteen participants were included. The mean age of the treatment group was 72 years and that of the control group was 69 years. Participants' scores on the fear of falling measure improved after treatment with virtual reality associated with serious games, leading to a significant difference between the two groups.Conclusion: Virtual reality exposure therapy associated with serious games can be used in the treatment of fear of falling. The two techniques are complementary (top-down and bottom-up processes). To our knowledge, this is the first time that a combination of the two has been assessed. There was a specific effect of this therapy on the phobic reaction. Further studies are needed to confirm its efficacy and identify its underlying mechanism.
[Answer]   YES

[Title]    Effects of Virtual Reality-Based Physical and Cognitive Training on Executive Function and Dual-Task Gait Performance in Older Adults With Mild Cognitive Impairment: A Randomized Control Trial.
[Journal]  FRONTIERS IN AGING NEUROSCIENCE 11.
[Abstract] Background: Walking while performing cognitive and motor tasks simultaneously interferes with gait performance and may lead to falls in older adults with mild cognitive impairment (MCI). Executive function, which seems to play a key role in dual-task gait performance, can be improved by combined physical and cognitive training. Virtual reality (VR) has the potential to assist rehabilitation, and its effect on physical and cognitive function requires further investigation. The purpose of this study was to assess the effects of VR-based physical and cognitive training on executive function and dual-task gait performance in older adults with MCI, as well as to compare VR-based physical and cognitive training with traditional combined physical and cognitive training.Method: Thirty-four community-dwelling older adults with MCI were randomly assigned into either a VR-based physical and cognitive training (VR) group or a combined traditional physical and cognitive training (CPC) group for 36 sessions over 12 weeks. Outcome measures included executive function [Stroop Color and Word Test (SCWT) and trail making test (TMT) A and B], gait performance (gait speed, stride length, and cadence) and dual-task costs (DTCs). Walking tasks were performed during single-task walking, walking while performing serial subtraction (cognitive dual task), and walking while carrying a tray (motor dual task). The GAIT Up system was used to evaluate gait parameters including speed, stride length, cadence and DTCs. DTC were defined as 100 * (single-task gait parameters dual-task gait parameters)/single-task gait parameters.Results: Both groups showed significant improvements in the SCWT and single-task and motor dual-task gait performance measures. However, only the VR group showed improvements in cognitive dual-task gait performance and the DTC of cadence. Moreover, the VR group showed more improvements than the CPC group in the TMT-B and DTC of cadence with borderline significances.Conclusion: A 12-week VR-based physical and cognitive training program led to significant improvements in dual-task gait performance in older adults with MCI, which may be attributed to improvements in executive function.

[Title]    Effects of Kinect-based exergaming on frailty status and physical performance in prefrail and frail elderly: A randomized controlled trial.
[Journal]  SCIENTIFIC REPORTS 9.
[Abstract] Frailty status can be improved by intervention. Both exergaming and combined exercise have been proposed for improving physical performance in community-dwelling elderly. However, whether frailty status can be improved by exergaming is unclear. Moreover, whether Kinect-based exergaming training can exert a stronger effect on improving frailty status than combined exercise needs to be established. The aim of this study was to investigate the effects of Kinect-based exergaming on improving frailty status and physical performance in the prefrail and frail elderly by comparing its effects with those of combined exercise. Fifty-two prefrail and frail elderly were recruited and randomized to the Kinect-based exergaming group (EXER group) or combined exercise group (CE group), emphasizing resistance, aerobic, and balance training for 36 sessions over 12 weeks. Our results showed that both groups improved the frailty status (EXER group: p = 0.016, effect size = 2.29; and CE group: p = 0.031, effect size= 2.67). Three out of 5 physical characteristics of the frailty phenotype, namely, weakness, slow walking speed, and low activity level, were significantly reversed by both exergaming and combined exercise. However, the exergaming training also significantly reversed exhaustion. Furthermore, compared with the CE group, the EXER group showed greater improvement in dynamic balance control, as indicated by the forward reaching test (p = 0.0013, effect size = 0.40) and single leg stance test (p = 0.049, effect size = 0.42). Thus, Kinect-based exergaming exerted effects that were at least as beneficial as those of combined exercise in improving frailty status and the frailty phenotype. We recommend the use of exergaming aided by Kinect in the prefrail and frail elderly.

[Title]    Design of virtual reality training program for prevention of falling in the elderly: A pilot study on complex versus balance exercises.
[Journal]  EUROPEAN JOURNAL OF INTEGRATIVE MEDICINE 15: 64-67.
[Abstract] Introduction: Virtual reality (VR) exercises have been investigated as a rehabilitation paradigm to reduce the risk of falling in the elderly. This study aimed to compare a VR program consisted of complex exercises and that of balance exercises.Methods: The study was a single-blind, randomized, comparative trial conducted over 5 weeks. Twenty subjects over 65 years of age were divided into a complex exercise with virtual reality (CEVR) group and a balance exercise with virtual reality (BEVR) group. CEVR consisted of strengthening, flexibility, endurance, and balance exercises, while BEVR focused on balance exercises only. Before and after 10 times of 1 h training sessions, we measured isokinetic peak torque and total work of knee muscles using a dynamometer. The Timed Up & Go (TUG) test was also conducted to evaluate dynamic balance.Results: Knee extension peak torque was significantly enhanced only in the CEVR group (p < 0.05), but there was no difference between groups. Both groups showed significant improvement of dynamic balance measured by TUG after training sessions, but the CEVR group exhibited greater improvement than the BEVR group (p < 0.05).Conclusions: Our findings demonstrate the superiority of the virtual reality training with a complex exercise program to improve balance and muscle strength in the elderly when compared to the BEVR. As a training for prevention of falling in the elderly, we recommend a virtual reality program including various exercises for strength, endurance, balance, and flexibility.

[Title]    Effects and Feasibility of a Memory Exergame Training in Older Adults: A Randomized Controlled Trial.
[Journal]  GAMES FOR HEALTH JOURNAL 10(6): 383-390.
[Abstract] Objective: The aim of the study is to assess the feasibility, sustainability, and effectiveness of task-specific memory exergame training on motor-cognitive performance in older adults.Materials and Methods: Fifty older adults (age: 78.8 +/- 7.0 years) participated in a randomized controlled trial with a 10-week intervention and 3-month follow-up period. Both the intervention group (IG: n = 29) and control group (CG: n = 21) underwent a once-weekly exercise program, including strength and balance exercises, while the IG performed an additional exergame training, combining dynamic balance with visuospatial memory tasks. Outcome measures were completion time for distinct levels of memory exergame tasks without (condition 1) and with procedural support (condition 2) and (sub)-total game scores documented by a game-specific assessment strategy.Results: Significant improvements in the IG compared with the CG over the intervention period were found for completion times in most of the analyzed levels of condition 1 (P < 0.001-0.047; eta(2)(p) = 0.238-0.335) and one level of condition 2 (P < 0.001, eta(2)(p) = 0.267), for the subtotal game score of condition 1 (P = 0.002; eta(2)(p) = 0.186), and for the total game score (P = 0.005; eta(2)(p) = 0.162). Improvements were partially sustained 3 months after training cessation (P = 0.008-0.039, eta(2)(p) = 0.095-0.174). Completion rates for initial levels were 86%-98%. No clinical events or safety issues were observed during the training.Conclusion: The study demonstrates that additional memory exergame training effectively, and sustainably, improves performance in complex motor-cognitive tasks involving dynamic balance and visuospatial memory in older adults.

[Title]    Effects of Exergaming-Based Tai Chi on Cognitive Function and Dual-Task Gait Performance in Older Adults With Mild Cognitive Impairment: A Randomized Control Trial.
[Journal]  FRONTIERS IN AGING NEUROSCIENCE 14.
[Abstract] BackgroundDeclined cognitive function interferes with dual-task walking ability and may result in falls in older adults with mild cognitive impairment (MCI). The mind-body exercise, Tai Chi (TC), improves cognition and dual-task ability. Exergaming is low-cost, safe, highly scalable, and feasible. Whether the effects of exergaming-based TC is beneficial than traditional TC has not been investigated yet. ObjectivesThe objective of this study was to investigate effects of exergaming-based TC on cognitive function and dual-task walking among older adults with MCI. MethodsFifty patients with MCI were randomly assigned to an exergaming-based TC (EXER-TC) group, a traditional TC (TC) group, or a control group. The EXER-TC and TC groups received 36 training sessions (three, 50-min sessions per week) during a 12-week period. The control group received no intervention and were instructed to maintain their usual daily physical activities. The outcome variables measured included those related to cognitive function, dual-task cost (DTC), and gait performance. ResultsThe EXER-TC and TC groups performed better than the control group on the Chinese version of the Stroop Color and Word Test, the Trail Making Test Parts A and B, the one-back test, gait speed, and DTC of gait speed in cognitive dual-task conditions after training. However, there were no significant differences between the EXER-TC and TC groups. Compared with the control group, only the EXER-TC group experienced beneficial effects for the Montreal Cognitive Assessment. ConclusionEXER-TC was comparable to traditional TC for enhancement of dual-task gait performance and executive function. These results suggested that the EXER-TC approach has potential therapeutic use in older adults with MCI.
[Answer]   YES
[Response] YES. The paper meets the criteria for being about the use of exergames to prevent falls in the elderly. The intervention targets older adults with mild cognitive impairment, and the intervention includes an exergaming-based Tai Chi (EXER-TC) program. The study is a randomized controlled trial, and the results are reported. Although the primary focus is on cognitive function and dual-task gait performance, these outcomes are related to fall risk, as improved cognitive function and gait performance can help reduce the likelihood of falls.

[Title]    Comparison of Slip Training in VR Environment And on Moveable Platform.
[Journal]  Biomedical sciences instrumentation 51: 189-197.
[Abstract] Slip training is gaining popularity as an innovative fall intervention approach. The objective of this study was to compare the efficacy of two different slip training modality (moveable platform and virtual reality) in reducing fall frequency and improving reactive recovery in older adults. Thirty-six healthy older adults were involved in a laboratory study, and were equally and randomly divided into the control group, the moveable platform training (MPT) group, and the virtual reality training (VRT) group. The MPT was achieved by inducing slips using a custom built sliding device consisting of a low friction, motorized moveable platform. The VRT was conducted by inducing visual perturbation in a head mounted display while subjects walked on a treadmill. All groups performed slip trials (kinematics, kinetics and EMG data were collected) on an actual slippery floor surface before and after a training session. The results indicated a significant reduction in fall frequency in both training groups. Between MPT and VRT groups, significant differences were also found in forward trunk rotations, peak knee angular velocity, ankle coactivity, and muscular activity in tibialis anterior. It was concluded that slip training in VR environment could produce comparable results in fall intervention.
[Answer]   YES
[Response] YES. The paper meets the criteria for being about the use of exergames to prevent falls in the elderly:
1. The intervention targets older adults.
2. The intervention includes a virtual reality (VR) training, which is a form of exergame.

[Title]    The Braking Force in Walking: Age-related Differences and Improvement in Older Adults With Exergame Training.
[Journal]  JOURNAL OF AGING AND PHYSICAL ACTIVITY 22(4): 518-526.
[Abstract] The purposes of this present research were, in the first study, to determine whether age impacts a measure of postural control (the braking force in walking) and, in a second study, to determine whether exergame training in physically-simulated sport activity would show transfer, increasing the braking force in walking and also improving balance assessed by clinical measures, functional fitness, and health-related quality of life in older adults. For the second study, the authors developed an active video game training program (using the Wii system) with a pretest-training-posttest design comparing an experimental group (24 1-hr sessions of training) with a control group. Participants completed a battery comprising balance (braking force in short and normal step conditions), functional fitness (Senior Fitness Test), and health-related quality of life (SF-36). Results show that 12 weeks of video game-based exercise program training improved the braking force in the normal step condition, along with the functional fitness of lower limb strength, cardiovascular endurance, and motor agility, as measured by the Senior Fitness Test. Only the global mental dimension of the SF-36 was sensitive to exergame practice. Exergames appear to be an effective way to train postural control in older adults. Because of the multimodal nature of the activity, exergames provide an effective tool for remediation of age-related problems.

[Title]    The Effect of Non-Immersive Virtual Reality Exergames versus Traditional Physiotherapy in Parkinson's Disease Older Patients: Preliminary Results from a Randomized-Controlled Trial.
[Journal]  INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL RESEARCH AND PUBLIC HEALTH 19(22).
[Abstract] (1) Background: Parkinson's disease (PD) is one of the most frequent causes of disability among older people. Recently, virtual reality and exergaming have been emerged as promising tools for gait and balance rehabilitation in PD patients. Our purpose is to evaluate an innovative treatment for older patients with PD, based on non-immersive virtual reality exergames, improving gait and balance and reducing falling risk. (2) Methods: Thirty PD patients were recruited and randomly divided into two groups, to receive a traditional rehabilitation (CG) or a technological rehabilitation (TG). (3) Results: A statistical improvement of balance at the end of treatments was observed in both groups (CG: 12.4 +/- 0.7 vs. 13.5 +/- 0.8, p = 0.017; TG: 13.8 +/- 0.5 vs. 14.7 +/- 0.4, p = 0.004), while the overall risk of falling was significantly reduced only in the TG (POMA Total: 24.6 +/- 0.9 vs. 25.9 +/- 0.7, p = 0.010). The results between groups shows that all POMA scores differ in a statistically significant manner in the TG, emphasizing improvement not only in balance but also in gait characteristics (9.7 +/- 0.8 vs. 11.4 +/- 0.2, p = 0.003). Moreover, TG also improves the psychological sphere, measured thorough MSC-(17.1 +/- 0.4 vs. 16.5 +/- 0.4, p = 0.034). Although an improvement in FES-I and Gait Speed can be observed, this increase does not turn out to be significant. (4) Conclusions: Results suggest how non-immersive virtual reality exergaming technology offers the opportunity to effectively train cognitive and physical domains at the same time.

[Title]    Addition of a non-immersive virtual reality component to treadmill training to reduce fall risk in older adults (V-TIME): a randomised controlled trial.
[Journal]  LANCET 388(10050): 1170-1182.
[Abstract] Background Age-associated motor and cognitive deficits increase the risk of falls, a major cause of morbidity and mortality. Because of the significant ramifications of falls, many interventions have been proposed, but few have aimed to prevent falls via an integrated approach targeting both motor and cognitive function. We aimed to test the hypothesis that an intervention combining treadmill training with non-immersive virtual reality (VR) to target both cognitive aspects of safe ambulation and mobility would lead to fewer falls than would treadmill training alone.Methods We carried out this randomised controlled trial at five clinical centres across five countries (Belgium, Israel, Italy, the Netherlands, and the UK). Adults aged 60-90 years with a high risk of falls based on a history of two or more falls in the 6 months before the study and with varied motor and cognitive deficits were randomly assigned by use of computer-based allocation to receive 6 weeks of either treadmill training plus VR or treadmill training alone. Randomisation was stratified by subgroups of patients (those with a history of idiopathic falls, those with mild cognitive impairment, and those with Parkinson's disease) and sex, with stratification per clinical site. Group allocation was done by a third party not involved in onsite study procedures. Both groups aimed to train three times per week for 6 weeks, with each session lasting about 45 min and structured training progression individualised to the participant's level of performance. The VR system consisted of a motion-capture camera and a computer-generated simulation projected on to a large screen, which was specifically designed to reduce fall risk in older adults by including real-life challenges such as obstacles, multiple pathways, and distracters that required continual adjustment of steps. The primary outcome was the incident rate of falls during the 6 months after the end of training, which was assessed in a modified intention-to-treat population. Safety was assessed in all patients who were assigned a treatment. This study is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, NCT01732653.Findings Between Jan 6, 2013, and April 3, 2015, 302 adults were randomly assigned to either the treadmill training plus VR group (n=154) or treadmill training alone group (n=148). Data from 282 (93%) participants were included in the prespecified, modified intention-to-treat analysis. Before training, the incident rate of falls was similar in both groups (10.7 [SD 35.6] falls per 6 months for treadmill training alone vs 11.9 [39.5] falls per 6 months for treadmill training plus VR). In the 6 months after training, the incident rate was significantly lower in the treadmill training plus VR group than it had been before training (6.00 [95% CI 4.36-8.25] falls per 6 months; p<0.0001 vs before training), whereas the incident rate did not decrease significantly in the treadmill training alone group (8.27 [5.55-12.31] falls per 6 months; p=0.49). 6 months after the end of training, the incident rate of falls was also significantly lower in the treadmill training plus VR group than in the treadmill training group (incident rate ratio 0.58, 95% CI 0.36-0.96; p=0.033). No serious training-related adverse events occurred.Interpretation In a diverse group of older adults at high risk for falls, treadmill training plus VR led to reduced fall rates compared with treadmill training alone.

[Journal]  AGE AND AGEING 48(4): 506-512.
[Abstract] Background: gamification is a potentially attractive option for improving balance and reducing falls.Objectives: to assess the effect of balance training using the Nintendo (TM) Wii game console on balance (primary outcome), falls and fear of falling.Design: quasi-randomised, open-label, controlled clinical trial in parallel groups, carried out on community-dwelling patients over 70 years, able to walk independently. Participants were assigned 1:1 to the intervention or control group. Balance training was conducted using the Nintendo WiiFit (TM) twice a week for 3 months. Balance was assessed using the Tinetti balance test (primary outcome), the unipedal stance and the Wii balance tests at baseline, 3 months and 1 year. Falls were recorded and Fear of falling was assessed by the Falls Efficacy Scale (Short-FES-I).Results: 1,016 subjects were recruited (508 in both the intervention and the control group; of whom 274 and 356 respectively completed the 3-month assessment). There was no between-group difference in the Tinetti balance test score, with a baseline mean of 14.7 (SD 1.8) in both groups, and 15.2 (1.3) at 3 months in the intervention group compared to 15.3 (1.7) in controls; the between-group difference was 0.06 (95% CI 0.30-0.41). No differences were seen in any of the other balance tests, or in incident falls. There was a reduction in the fear of falling at 3 months, but no effect at 1 year.Conclusions: the study found no effect of balance training using the Nintendo (TM) Wii on balance or falls in older community-dwelling patients.

[Title]    Study protocol of a randomized clinical trial evaluating the effectiveness of a primary care intervention using the Nintendo™ Wii console to improve balance and decrease falls in the elderly.
[Journal]  BMC GERIATRICS 16.
[Abstract] Background: Balance alteration is a risk factor for falls in elderly individuals that has physical, psychological and economic consequences. The objectives of this study are to evaluate the usefulness of an intervention utilizing the Nintendo (TM) Wii console in order to improve balance, thereby decreasing both the fear of falling as well as the number of falls, and to evaluate the correlation between balance as determined by the console and the value obtained in the Tinetti tests and the one foot stationary test.Methods/Design: This is a controlled, randomized clinical trial of individual assignment, carried out on patients over 70 years in age, from five primary care centers in the city of Mataro (Barcelona). 380 patients were necessary for the intervention group that carried out the balance board exercises in 2 sessions per week for a 3 month period, and 380 patients in the control group who carried out their usual habits. Balance was evaluated using the Tinetti test, the one foot stationary test and with the console, at the start of the study, at the end of the intervention (3 months) and one year later. Quarterly telephone follow-up was also conducted to keep track of falls and their consequences.Discussion: The study aimed to connect the community with a technology that may be an easy and fun way to assist the elderly in improving their balance without the need to leave home or join rehabilitation groups, offering greater comfort for this population and decreasing healthcare costs since there is no need for specialized personnel.

[Title]    Perceptive-Cognitive and Physical Function in Prefrail Older Adults: Exergaming Versus Traditional Multicomponent Training.
[Journal]  REJUVENATION RESEARCH 24(1): 28-36.
[Abstract] Research highlights the benefits of regular traditional multicomponent training in older adults. The potential effect of exergames on perceptive-cognitive and physical function in prefrail older adults is still little explored. The study aimed to compare the effects of two physical exercise training programs (exergaming vs. traditional multicomponent) on perceptive-cognitive and physical functions of prefrail older adults. This study was a randomized controlled trial having 66 prefrail older adults assigned to two groups (exergame group [EG]:n = 32, 70.84 +/- 4.53 years; multicomponent group [MG]:n = 34, 70.76 +/- 5.60 years). Frailty phenotype, fall history, basic and advanced cognition, perceptual, physical (mobility, gait speed, and balance), and muscle (strength and power) functions were evaluated. Intervention was conducted during 12 weeks. The EG and MG performed similar exercise routines involving the main lower limb muscle groups required in daily activities. A mixed model analysis of variance (ANOVA) and effect size (d) revealed that both programs were effective in postponing frailty status, reducing the fear of falling (EG:d = 1.65; MG:d = 1.40), increasing fall risk awareness (EG:d = 2.14; MG:d = 1.60), improving cognitive status (EG:d = 0.83-2.61; MG:d = 0.86-1.43), muscle (EG:d = 0.54; MG:d = 0.51-0.73), and physical function (EG:d = 0.97-1.55; MG:d = 1.01-2.23). The exergame training might be a better alternative to improve cognition, whereas the multicomponent program may be a better option to provide physical function gains.
[Answer]   YES
[Response] YES. The paper meets the criteria for being about the use of exergames to prevent falls in the elderly:
1. The intervention targets prefrail older adults.
2. The intervention includes an exergame (exergaming group).
3. The study is a randomized controlled trial, and the results are reported.

[Title]    Wii Fit is effective in women with bone loss condition associated with balance disorders: a randomized controlled trial.
[Journal]  AGING CLINICAL AND EXPERIMENTAL RESEARCH 28(6): 1187-1193.
[Abstract] The use of exergame for balance competencies was recently explored in women affected by balance ability reduction with non-conclusive results. The aim of the study was to evaluate the efficacy of a supervised exergame performed with the Wii Fit(A (R)) compared to conventional exercises on balance function, quality of life, fear of fall and well-being in women with bone loss. Thirty-eight female participants aged over 65 years, with a bone loss condition, were enrolled and random allocated in the Wii group or control group. Subject enrolled in Wii group performed a balance training with a Wii Fit supervised by a physiotherapist (1 h, 2 days per week, during 8 weeks) while in control subjects performed the same amount of conventional balance exercises. Subject enrolled in experimental group showed significantly higher scores in terms of Berg Balance Scale (p = 0.027). In SF-36 scores, a significant difference was reported for physical activity score after treatment (p = 0.031). Fear of falling and the psychological scales were not significantly different between the two groups. In women with bone loss condition, a supervised Wii Fit training has shown better efficacy in improving balance performance with respect to conventional balance exercises.

[Title]    Supervised Balance Training and Wii Fit-Based Exercises Lower Falls Risk in Older Adults With Type 2 Diabetes.
[Journal]  JOURNAL OF THE AMERICAN MEDICAL DIRECTORS ASSOCIATION 19(2).
[Abstract] Objectives: This study examined the benefits of and differences between 12 weeks of thrice-weekly supervised balance training and an unsupervised at-home balance activity (using the Nintendo Wii Fit) for improving balance and reaction time and lowering falls risk in older individuals with type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM).Design: Before-after trial.Setting: University research laboratory, home environment.Participants: Sixty-five older adults with type 2 diabetes were recruited for this study. Participants were randomly allocated to either supervised balance training (mean age 67.8 +/- 5.2) or unsupervised training using the Nintendo Wii Fit balance board (mean age 66.1 +/- 5.6).Intervention: The training period for both groups lasted for 12 weeks. Individuals were required to complete three 40-minute sessions per week for a total of 36 sessions.Measurement: The primary outcome measure was falls risk, which was as derived from the physiological profile assessment. In addition, measures of simple reaction time, lower limb proprioception, postural sway, knee flexion, and knee extension strength were also collected. Persons also self-reported any falls in the previous 6 months.Results: Both training programs resulted in a significant lowering of falls risk (P < .05). The reduced risk was attributable to significant changes in reaction times for the hand (P < .05), foot (P < .01), lower-limb proprioception (P < .01), and postural sway (P < .05).Conclusions: Overall, training led to a decrease in falls risk, which was driven by improvements in reaction times, lower limb proprioception, and general balance ability. Interestingly, the reduced falls risk occurred without significant changes in leg strength, suggesting that interventions to reduce falls risk that target intrinsic risk factors related to balance control (over muscle strength) may have positive benefits for the older adult with T2DM at risk for falls.

[Title]    Short and long-term effects of exergaming for the elderly.
[Journal]  SPRINGERPLUS 5.
[Abstract] Objective: Exergaming has been introduced in safe and beneficial intervention for the elderly. However, no study has examined exergaming-based interventions for the elderly that last several years. Therefore, we investigated the effectiveness and safety of a 12-week intervention using step training with exergaming for the elderly (12-week study). Moreover, we conducted an exergaming-based intervention for 3 years (3-year study).Materials and methods: 12-week study: Forty-two elderly persons participated in this study. Using an in-house developed exergaming protocol, a step training was performed for 15 min/session twice a week for 12 weeks. We investigated post-intervention changes in motor functions, successful step-rate, the intensity of exercise, which was evaluated using Borg scale (Rating of Perceived Exertion). 3-year study: An intervention using exergaming was conducted for 12 weeks by 20 elderly participants. Two courses/year of exercise were performed at 3-month intervals. This was continued for 3 years. The exercise continuation rate, its influence on motor functions were investigated.Results: 12-week study: Lower-limb muscle strength, balancing capacity, and whole body reaction time significantly improved in the exercise group. The mean score on Borg scale was 12 +/- 2 on the first day of the step exercise and 9 +/- 2 on the final day. 3-year study: Exercise was continued in 16 out of the 20 subjects. The Timed Up and Go Test, duration of one-footed standing, and quadriceps strength significantly improved.Conclusion: The results of the present study showed that exergaming provided an appropriate exercise intensity for the elderly and safely improved motor functions. The exercise continuation rate in the 3-year study was high. Improvements in motor functions may contribute to the prevention of falls.

[Title]    Dual-Task Training Program for Older Adults: Blending Gait, Visuomotor and Cognitive Training.
[Journal]  FRONTIERS IN NETWORK PHYSIOLOGY 1.
[Abstract] Objective: Physical and cognitive impairments are common with aging and often coexist. Changes in the level of physical and mental activity are prognostic for adverse health events and falls. Dual-task (DT) training programs that can improve mobility and cognition simultaneously can bring significant improvements in rehabilitation. The objective of this mixed methods exploratory RCT was to provide evidence for the feasibility and therapeutic value of a novel game-assisted DT exercise program in older adults.Methods: Twenty-two community dwelling participants, between the ages of 70-85 were randomized to either dual-task treadmill walking (DT-TR) or dual-task recumbent bicycle (DT-RC). Both groups viewed a standard LED computer monitor and performed a range of cognitive game tasks while walking or cycling; made possible with the use of a "hands-free", miniature, inertial-based computer mouse. Participants performed their respective 1-h DT exercise program twice a week, for 12 weeks at a community fitness centre. Semi-structured interviews and qualitative analysis was conducted to evaluate the participant's experiences with the exercise program. Quantitative analysis included measures of standing balance, gait function (spatiotemporal gait variable), visuomotor and executive cognitive function, tested under single and DT walking conditions.Results: Compliance was 100% for all 22 participants. Four themes captured the range of participant's experiences and opinions: 1) reasons for participation, 2) difficulties with using the technologies, 3) engagement with the computer games, and 4) positive effects of the program. Both groups showed significant improvements in standing balance performance, visuomotor and visuospatial executive function. However, significant improvement in dual task gait function was observed only in the DT-TR group. Medium to large effect sizes were observed for most balance, spatiotemporal gait variables, and cognitive performance measure.Conclusion: With only minor difficulties with the technology being reported, the findings demonstrate feasible trial procedures and acceptable DT oriented training with a high compliance rate and positive outcomes. These findings support further research and development, and will direct the next phase of a full-scale RCT.

[Title]    Home-Based Exercise Program Improves Balance and Fear of Falling in Community-Dwelling Older Adults with Mild Alzheimer's Disease: A Pilot Study.
[Journal]  JOURNAL OF ALZHEIMERS DISEASE 59(2): 565-574.
[Abstract] Background/Objective: Balance problems are common in older adults with Alzheimer's disease (AD). The objective was to study the effects of a Wii-Fit interactive video-game-led physical exercise program to a walking program on measures of balance in older adults with mild AD.Methods: A prospective randomized controlled parallel-group trial (Wii-Fit versus walking) was conducted in thirty community-dwelling older adults (73 +/- 6.2 years) with mild AD. Home-based exercises were performed under caregiver supervision for 8 weeks. Primary (Berg Balance Scale, BBS) and secondary outcomes (fear of falls and quality of life) were measured at baseline, 8 weeks (end of intervention), and 16 weeks (8-weeks post-intervention).Results: At 8 weeks, there was a significantly greater improvement (average inter-group difference [95% CI]) in theWii-Fit group compared to the walking group in BBS (4.8 [3.3-6.2], p < 0.001), after adjusting for baseline. This improvement was sustained at 16 weeks (3.5 [2.0-5.0], p < 0.001). Analyses of the secondary outcome measures indicated that there was a significantly greater improvement in the Wii-Fit group compared to walking group in Activity-specific Balance Confidence scale (6.5 [3.6-9.4], p < 0.001) and Falls Efficacy Scale (-4.8 [-7.6 to -2.0], p = 0.002) at 8 weeks. However, this effect was not sustained at 16 weeks. Quality of life improved in both groups at 8 weeks; however, there were no inter-group differences (p = 0.445).Conclusion: Home-based, caregiver-supervised Wii-Fit exercises improve balance and may reduce fear of falling in community-dwelling older adults with mild AD.

[Title]    Effects of Perturbation-Based Slip Training Using a Virtual Reality Environment on Slip-induced Falls.
[Journal]  ANNALS OF BIOMEDICAL ENGINEERING 43(4): 958-967.
[Abstract] The purpose of the current study was to design and evaluate the effectiveness of virtual reality training in improving recovery reactions and reducing fall frequency in older adults. Twenty-four older adults were recruited and randomly assigned to two groups (virtual reality training and control). Both groups underwent three sessions including baseline slip, training and transfer of training on slippery surface. Both groups experienced two slips, one during baseline and the other during the transfer of training trial. The training group underwent 12 simulated slips using a visual perturbation induced by tilting a virtual reality scene while walking on the treadmill and the control group performed normal walking during the training session. Kinematic and kinetic data were collected during all the sessions. Results demonstrated a reduced incidence of falls in the training group during the transfer of training trial as compared to the control group. The training group was able to transfer reactive control strategies learned during training to the second slip trial. The reactive adjustments included reduced slip distance. Additionally, gait parameters reflective of gait instability (stride length, step width, variability in stride velocity) reduced after walking in the VR environment for 15-20 min. The results indicated a beneficial effect of the virtual reality training in reducing slip severity and recovery kinematics in healthy older adults.
[Answer]   YES
[Response] YES. The paper meets the criteria for being about the use of exergames to prevent falls in the elderly:

[Title]    EMG and Kinematic Responses to Unexpected Slips After Slip Training in Virtual Reality.
[Journal]  IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON BIOMEDICAL ENGINEERING 62(2): 593-599.
[Abstract] The objective of the study was to design a virtual reality (VR) training to induce perturbation in older adults similar to a slip and examine the effect of the training on kinematic and muscular responses in older adults. Twenty-four older adults were involved in a laboratory study and randomly assigned to two groups (VR training and control). Both groups went through three sessions including baseline slip, training, and transfer of training on slippery surface. The training group experienced 12 simulated slips using a visual perturbation induced by tilting a VR scene while walking on the treadmill and the control group completed normal walking during the training session. Kinematic, kinetic, and electromyography data were collected during all the sessions. Results demonstrated the proactive adjustments such as increased trunk flexion at heel contact after training. Reactive adjustments included reduced time to peak activations of knee flexors, reduced knee coactivation, reduced time to trunk flexion, and reduced trunk angular velocity after training. In conclusion, the study findings indicate that the VR training was able to generate a perturbation in older adults that evoked recovery reactions and such motor skill can be transferred to the actual slip trials.

[Title]    A New Approach to Improve Cognition, Muscle Strength, and Postural Balance in Community-Dwelling Elderly with a 3-D Virtual Reality Kayak Program.
[Journal]  TOHOKU JOURNAL OF EXPERIMENTAL MEDICINE 238(1): 1-8.
[Abstract] Aging is usually accompanied with deterioration of physical abilities, such as muscular strength, sensory sensitivity, and functional capacity. Recently, intervention methods with virtual reality have been introduced, providing an enjoyable therapy for elderly. The aim of this study was to investigate whether a 3-D virtual reality kayak program could improve the cognitive function, muscle strength, and balance of community dwelling elderly. Importantly, kayaking involves most of the upper body musculature and needs the balance control. Seventy-two participants were randomly allocated into the kayak program group (n = 36) and the control group (n = 36). The two groups were well matched with respect to general characteristics at baseline. The participants in both groups performed a conventional exercise program for 30 min, and then the 3-D virtual reality kayak program was performed in the kayak program group for 20 min, two times a week for 6 weeks. Cognitive function was measured using the Montreal Cognitive Assessment. Muscle strength was measured using the arm curl and handgrip strength tests. Standing and sitting balance was measured using the Good Balance system. The post-test was performed in the same manner as the pre-test; the overall outcomes such as cognitive function (p < 0.05), muscle strength (p < 0.05), and balance (standing and sitting balance, p < 0.05) were significantly improved in kayak program group compared to the control group. We propose that the 3-D virtual reality kayak program is a promising intervention method for improving the cognitive function, muscle strength, and balance of elderly.

[Title]    Effectiveness of virtual reality games for falls, postural oscillations, pain and quality of life of individual HAM/TSP: a randomized, controlled, clinical trial.
[Journal]  JOURNAL OF NEUROVIROLOGY 26(5): 676-686.
[Abstract] People with HTLV-1 associated myelopathy or tropical spastic paraparesis (HAM/TSP) have sensorimotor losses and postural instability, resulting in frequent falls. These findings stimulate the use of exercise protocols associated with postural control. This study investigated the effectiveness of a balance training exercise protocol through a virtual game. This is a randomized crossover clinical trial performed in subjects with imbalance disorders (HAM/TSP). To evaluate postural oscillations by baropodometry (total area, anterior, posterior and lateral projection), the Footwork (R) system was used and by cinemetry (angle of the body, hip and ankle alignment in the lateral view), the CVMob system. In addition, the Brief Pain Inventory and the WHOQoL Bref were used to measure pain intensity and quality of life. Comparison tests of the averages (intra and inter groups) and correlations were applied considering an alpha of 5% and power of 80%. The study was approved by the Ethics Committee of the Catholic University of Salvador and registered in the Clinical Trials database (NCT02877030). The final sample consisted of 26, predominantly female subjects. An increase in the postural oscillations of the control subjects (p < 0.05), a reduction in the occurrence of falls (p = 0.039) and an improvement in the quality of life of the control-test group (p < 0.05) were observed. Virtual game training did not improve the static balance, promoting an increase in postural oscillations. Immediately after the application of the protocol, there was a reduction in fall occurrence and improvement in the quality of life.
[Answer]   YES
[Response] YES. The paper meets the criteria for being about the use of exergames to prevent falls in the elderly. Here's the breakdown:. 1. Intervention Targets: The study includes individuals with HAM/TSP, which is a condition that can affect older people and is associated with sensorimotor losses and postural instability, leading to frequent falls.
2. Intervention: The intervention involves a balance training exercise protocol through a virtual game, which qualifies as an exergame.
3. Study Design: The study is a randomized, controlled, clinical trial, and the results are reported.
4. Exclusion Criteria: The paper is not a meta-analysis, review, or feasibility analysis; it presents original data from a randomized controlled trial.. Therefore, the answer is "YES."

[Title]    A Multimodal Training Modulates Short Afferent Inhibition and Improves Complex Walking in a Cohort of Faller Older Adults With an Increased Prevalence of Parkinson's Disease.
[Journal]  JOURNALS OF GERONTOLOGY SERIES A-BIOLOGICAL SCIENCES AND MEDICAL SCIENCES 75(4): 722-728.
[Abstract] Background: Falls are frequent in Parkinson's disease and aging. Impairments in the cholinergic-mediated attentional supervision of gait may contribute to increased fall risk, especially when obstacles challenge gait. Interventions combining motor-cognitive approaches have been shown to improve motor performance, cognitive skills, and falls number. Here, we hypothesized that an intervention simulating an attention-demanding walking condition could affect not only complex gait performance and fall risk but also short-latency afferent inhibition (SAI), as a marker of cholinergic activity.Methods: Thirty-nine participants at falls risk (24 Parkinson's disease participants and 15 older adults) were recruited in a randomized controlled trial. Participants were assigned to treadmill training or treadmill training with non-immersive virtual reality intervention and trained three times a week for 6 weeks. SAI, a transcranial magnetic stimulation paradigm, was used to assess cholinergic activity. Gait kinematics was measured during usual walking and while negotiating physical obstacles. Transcranial magnetic stimulation and gait assessments were performed pre, post, and 6 months post-intervention.Results: Treadmill training combined with non-immersive virtual reality induced an increase in inhibition of the SAI protocol on cortical excitability, improved obstacle negotiation performance, and induced a reduction of the number of falls compared with treadmill training. Furthermore, the more SAI increased after training, the more the obstacle negotiation performance improved and fall rate decreased.Conclusions: We provide evidence that an innovative rehabilitation approach targeting cognitive components of complex motor actions can induce changes in cortical cholinergic activity, as indexed by SAI, thereby enabling functional gait improvements.

[Title]    Beneficial Effects of Interactive Physical-Cognitive Game-Based Training on Fall Risk and Cognitive Performance of Older Adults.
[Journal]  INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL RESEARCH AND PUBLIC HEALTH 17(17).
[Abstract] Physical and cognitive declines are significant risk factors for falls. Promising evidence suggests that combined physical-cognitive training would be an effective fall risk reduction and cognitive improvement intervention. However, a limited number of studies have been conducted and findings have been inconclusive. This study investigated the effects of interactive physical-cognitive game-based training on the fall risk and cognitive performance of older adults. Forty participants were randomly allocated to the intervention (n = 20) and control (n = 20) groups. Participants in the intervention group performed a 1 h session, 3 times a week for 12 weeks of the interactive physical-cognitive game-based training program. Fall risk (Physiological Profile Assessment, PPA; and Timed Up and Go, TUG) and cognitive outcome (Montreal Cognitive Assessment, MoCA) were assessed at pre- and post-intervention. Thirty-nine participants (mean age = 69.81 +/- 3.78 years) completed the study (97.5%). At the end of the trial, participants in the intervention group demonstrated significant improvement in the PPA fall risk score (p= 0.015), postural sway (p= 0.005), MoCA score (p= 0.001), and TUG-dual task (p= 0.045) compared to controls. In conclusion, the interactive physical-cognitive, game-based training was effective in reducing physiological fall risk and improving cognitive function in community-dwelling older adults.
[Answer]   YES
[Response] YES. The paper meets all the criteria for being about the use of exergames to prevent falls in the elderly:
1. The intervention targets older adults (mean age = 69.81 ± 3.78 years).
2. The intervention is an interactive physical-cognitive game-based training, which qualifies as an exergame.
3. The study includes a randomized controlled trial, and the results are reported, showing significant improvements in fall risk and cognitive performance.

[Title]    Balance training using virtual reality improves balance and physical performance in older adults at high risk of falls.
[Journal]  CLINICAL INTERVENTIONS IN AGING 14: 1567-1577.
[Abstract] Purpose: Exercise programs designed for falls prevention have been proven effective in reducing falls by approximately 21%. Virtual reality may provide a viable alternative intervention for falls prevention. This study compared the effects of virtual reality training using the Balance Rehabilitation Unit (BRU) versus exercise using a modified Otago Exercise Programme (EX) on improving balance and physical performance in the short-term restorative care setting of the Gait and Balance Gym (Gabagym).Patients and methods: This was a pre- and post-intervention study of 195 participants (median age 78 years, IQR 73-84; 67% female) who presented with a risk and/or history of falls. Participants were assigned to either EX (n=82) or BRU (n=63). Supervised sessions occurred twice a week for 6 weeks. Participants receiving interventions were compared to a separate group (n=50) with similar characteristics who did not receive any intervention. Balance and physical performance were assessed at initial and final attendance and included the 5 Times Sit to Stand (5STS) test, Timed Up and Go (TUG), gait speed and posturography assessment using the BRU. Fear of falling was assessed using the Falls Efficacy Scale. Handgrip strength and adherence were also monitored.Results: Post-intervention, EX and BRU groups achieved similar improvements and reported similar adherence rates (71% vs 72%, respectively). Both intervention groups improved in balance and physical performance measures. Both interventions showed significantly better improvement than the non-intervention group in TUG (p<0.001), gait speed (p=0.021), limits of stability in posturography assessment (p=0.008), FES-I score (p=0.013) and handgrip strength (p=0.021). Only the BRU group improved control of static posture in the eyes closed (p=0.002) and foam eyes closed (p=0.006) tasks.Conclusion: This study highlights the potential use of virtual reality as a practical alternative to improve outcomes of balance training for reduction of falls risk in older adults.
[Answer]   YES
[Response] NO. The paper does not meet the criteria for a "YES" because, although it involves older adults and uses virtual reality (which can be considered an exergame) to improve balance and physical performance, it is not a randomized controlled trial. The study design is described as a pre- and post-intervention study, which does not meet the requirement for randomized controlled trials.

[Title]    Effects of strength and balance training on the mobility, fear of falling and grip strength of elderly female fallers.
[Journal]  Journal of bodywork and movement therapies 19(4): 646-650.
[Abstract] The aim of this study was to evaluate the effects of virtual reality and strength training on the balance, fear of falling and handgrip strength of older women with a history of falls. The fear of falling, mobility and grip strength were evaluated in 11 elderly fallers (72.4 ± 5.2 years). The faller group was submitted to 12 weeks of virtual reality and muscle strength training. The results showed improvement in mobility (p = 0.0004) and in the fear of falling (p = 0.002). No significant difference was observed for hand grip strength. It can be concluded that virtual reality and muscle strength interventions are beneficial for mobility and fear of falling in older women with a history of falls.
[Answer]   YES
[Response] YES. The paper meets the criteria for being about the use of exergames to prevent falls in the elderly:
1. The intervention targets older people (elderly female fallers, 72.4 ± 5.2 years).
2. The intervention includes virtual reality, which is a form of exergame.
3. The study reports the results of a randomized controlled trial, showing improvements in mobility and fear of falling.
4. The paper presents original data from a specific intervention, not a meta-analysis, review, or feasibility analysis.

[Title]    Immersive virtual reality is effective in the rehabilitation of older adults with balance disorders: A randomized clinical trial.
[Journal]  EXPERIMENTAL GERONTOLOGY 149.
[Abstract] Question: What are the effects of immersive virtual reality (IVR) training compared to conventional physiotherapy on body balance and risk of falls in older adults with balance disorders? Design: A randomized controlled trial with two intervention arms, concealed allocation, per-protocol analysis, and blinded assessment. Participants: Thirty-seven older adults with balance disorders and risk of falling. Intervention: Participants were randomized into two groups: a control group, which received balance training with conventional physiotherapy using multimodal circuit exercises, and an experimental group, which received balance training using immersive virtual reality. Both groups received 16 individual sessions, twice a week. Outcome measures: The primary outcome was functional balance. Secondary outcomes were static balance, gait speed, functional range, dizziness symptoms, and fear of falling. Safety was ensured by assessing any adverse events during the intervention. Results: After 16 sessions, in the intragroup analysis, the functional balance score in the experimental group increased by 3.00 (95% CI 1.42 to 4.57) and in the control group by 3.88 (95% CI 2.16 to 5.59). Both groups improved in assessments of sensory interaction and anterior reach. Only the experimental group presented increased mobility and reduced dizziness. After two months, there was a maintenance of gains in functional balance and a reduction of the gains in functional reach for both groups. In the intergroup comparison, there was no significant difference. Conclusion: Immersive Virtual Reality training proved to be effective for balance-related outcomes, although it was not superior to conventional therapy. Trial registration: RBR-3tk7fw.

[Title]    Effects of Kinect Adventures Games Versus Conventional Physical Therapy on Postural Control in Elderly People: A Randomized Controlled Trial.
[Journal]  GAMES FOR HEALTH JOURNAL 7(1): 24-36.
[Abstract] Objective: To compare the effectiveness of Kinect Adventures games versus conventional physiotherapy to improve postural control (PC), gait, cardiorespiratory fitness, and cognition of the elderly. In addition, we evaluated the safety, acceptability, and adherence to the interventions.Materials and Methods: The study was a randomized clinical trial in which 46 elderly individuals were selected, mean age 69.3 (5.34) years. Participants were allocated to the Kinect Adventures Training Group (KATG) or the Conventional Physical Therapy Group (CPTG), 23 individuals in each group. Participants of both groups participated in 14 training sessions lasting 1 hour each, twice a week. The KATG practiced four Kinect Adventures games. The CPTG participated in conventional physiotherapy. The primary outcome was PC: Mini-Balance Evaluation Systems Test (Mini-BESTest), and secondary outcomes were gait: Functional Gait Assessment (FGA), cardiorespiratory fitness: Six-minute step test (6MST), and cognition: Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MoCA). Acceptability was assessed through a questionnaire created by the researchers themselves. Adherence was assessed by the ''frequency of the number of elderly individuals who completed the interventions and safety through the presence of adverse effects.'' Participants were assessed immediately pre- and posttreatment and fourth week after the end of the treatment. Statistical analysis was done through repeated-measures analysis of variance and Tukey post hoc test.Results: Both groups presented a significant improvement in the PC (Mini-BEST), gait (FGA), and cognition (MoCA) posttreatment that was maintained at fourth week after treatment (post hoc Tukey test; P<0.05). Regarding cardiorespiratory fitness (6MST), the KATG presented improvement posttreatment and maintenance of the results in the fourth week after treatment. CPTG showed improvement only in fourth week after treatment (post hoc Tukey tests; P<0.05). Regarding the acceptability, the questionnaire showed that both groups were satisfied with regard to the proposed interventions. There was 91% adherence in both training sessions. Regarding the safety, 34% and 26% of the individuals of the KATG and CPTG, respectively, presented adverse effects of delayed muscle pain in the lower limbs after the first session only.Conclusion: There were no significant differences between the KATG and CPTG; both interventions provided positive effects on PC, gait, cardiorespiratory fitness, and cognition of the elderly.

[Title]    Effects of Dance Exergaming on Depressive Symptoms, Fear of Falling, and Musculoskeletal Function in Fallers and Nonfallers Community-Dwelling Older Women.
[Journal]  REJUVENATION RESEARCH 21(6): 518-526.
[Abstract] The aim of this study was to evaluate the effects of a pop dance exergaming protocol on fall risk factorsdepressive symptoms, fear of falling, and musculoskeletal functionin community-dwelling older female fallers and nonfallers. There were 47 community-dwelling older women assigned to the intervention group (IG) [fallers (n=10, 69.8 +/- 4.3 years); nonfallers (n=12, 68.9 +/- 3.3 years)] and the control group (CG) [fallers (n=12, 73.6 +/- 5.4 years); nonfallers (n=13, 68.7 +/- 4.8 years)]. The CG maintained their lifestyle and the IG performed a videogame dance training three times per week for 12 weeks. The Dance Central game for Xbox 360((R)) and Kinect motion sensor were used. The primary outcomes were geriatric depressive symptoms, fear of falling, and concentric and eccentric isokinetic peak torque (PT) of quadriceps and hamstrings. Secondary outcomes included cross-sectional area of quadriceps and hamstring muscles, functionality (Timed Up and Go test, gait speed, the Five Times Sit-to-Stand test), and a fall circumstances and outcomes recording. The depressive symptoms decreased in the Intervention Fallers Group. The eccentric hamstrings PT at 180 degrees/s increased in the Intervention Nonfallers Group. There were no significant differences between groups for the other variables analyzed. The training attendance was 83% for the Intervention Fallers Group and 88% for the Intervention Nonfallers Group. Dance exergaming can be indicated to decrease depressive symptoms in fallers and increase the PT in nonfallers among community-dwelling older women.

[Title]    The effect of exergaming on knee proprioception in older men: A randomized controlled trial.
[Journal]  ARCHIVES OF GERONTOLOGY AND GERIATRICS 69: 144-150.
[Abstract] Background: Proprioception is the ability to sense the body position, muscle sense, joint stability and posture. As balance decreases during the process of aging, knee proprioception has a critical role in body balance and daily activities. Exergaming has shown to be a potentially effective and more enjoyable form of exercise delivery.Objective: The purpose of this study was to determine the effect of an 8-week Xbox Kinect exercise program on knee proprioception in healthy older adults.Methodology: Thirty-two elderly men who were 65 years of age or older were randomly allocated to either a control or experimental group (allocation ratio 1: 1). The experimental group received an exergame intervention that included Xbox Kinect with games focusing on movements of the knee joint for 8 weeks (three times per week and 40 min per sessions). A Biodex Isokinetic Dynamometer was used to measure knee joint position sense before and after the exercise program.Results: After eight weeks of training, knee proprioception significantly improved in the intervention group for several knee joint angles: 30 degrees (3.5 +/- 1.1), 45 degrees (3.1 +/- 0.9), and 60 degrees (3.0 +/- 0.6) compared to the control group 30 degrees (5.2 +/- 0.8), 45 degrees (5.2 +/- 0.8), and 60 degrees (6.2 +/- 0.9) (dominant leg F1, 28 = 23.469, p = 0.001. eta 2 = 0.456; non-dominant leg F1, 28 = 23.076, p = 0.001. eta 2 = 0.452).Conclusion: The results from this study indicate that exergame intervention can enhance knee proprioception in elderly men.

[Answer]   YES
[Response] YES. The paper meets the criteria for being about the use of exergames to prevent falls in the elderly:
1. The intervention targets older men (65 years of age or older).
2. The intervention is an exergame, specifically using Xbox Kinect with games focusing on movements of the knee joint.
3. The study is a randomized controlled trial, and the results are reported.
4. The paper presents original data from the trial, not a meta-analysis, review, or feasibility analysis. . While the primary focus is on knee proprioception, improved proprioception can contribute to better balance and, consequently, a reduced risk of falls in the elderly. Therefore, this study is relevant to the use of exergames to prevent falls in the elderly.

[Title]    Effects of 8 Weeks of Balance Training, Virtual Reality Training, and Combined Exercise on Lower Limb Muscle Strength, Balance, and Functional Mobility Among Older Men: A Randomized Controlled Trial.
[Journal]  SPORTS HEALTH-A MULTIDISCIPLINARY APPROACH 13(6): 606-612.
[Abstract] Background: Poor muscle strength, balance, and functional mobility have predicted falls in older adults. Fall prevention guidelines recommend highly challenging balance training modes to decrease falls; however, it is unclear whether certain modes are more effective. The purpose of this study was to determine whether traditional balance training (BT), virtual reality balance training (VR), or combined exercise (MIX) relative to a waitlist control group (CON) would provoke greater improvements in strength, balance, and functional mobility as falls risk factor proxies for falls in older men.Hypothesis: We hypothesized that 8 weeks of MIX will provoke the greatest improvements in falls risk factors, followed by similar improvements after BT and VR, relative to the CON.Study Design: Single-blinded randomized controlled trial NCT02778841 (ClinicalTrials.gov identifier).Level of Evidence: Level 2.Methods: In total, 64 community-dwelling older men (age 71.8 +/- 6.09 years) were randomly assigned into BT, VR, MIX, and CON groups and tested at baseline and at the 8-week follow-up. The training groups exercised for 40 minutes, 3 times per week, for 8 weeks. Isokinetic quadriceps and hamstrings strength on the dominant and nondominant legs were primary outcomes measured by the Biodex Isokinetic Dynamometer. Secondary outcomes included 1-legged stance on firm and foam surfaces, tandem stance, the timed-up-and-go, and gait speed. Separate one-way analyses of covariance between groups were conducted for each outcome using baseline scores as covariates.Results: (1) MIX elicited greater improvements in strength, balance, and functional mobility relative to BT, VR, and CON; (2) VR exhibited better balance and functional mobility relative to BT and CON; and (3) BT demonstrated better balance and functional mobility relative to CON.Conclusion: The moderate to large effect sizes in strength and large effect sizes for balance and functional mobility underline that MIX is an effective method to improve falls risk among older adults.

[Title]    Does exercise intensity increment in exergame promote changes in strength, functional capacity and perceptual parameters in pre-frail older women? A randomized controlled trial.
[Journal]  EXPERIMENTAL GERONTOLOGY 116: 25-30.
[Abstract] The aim of this study was to compare the effects of two exercise intensities on exergame training program in muscle strength, functional capacity and perceptual parameters in pre-frail older women. Thirty-four women (69.5 +/- 5.4 years) were randomly assigned to either moderate-(MG: 11-13 perceived exertion) or vigorous-exercise intensity group (VG: 14-16 perceived exertion). Muscle strength and functional capacity were evaluated before and after 3 months of training. The affective responses were measured once a week and perceived benefit was evaluated after training period. The MG improved the average power at 60 degrees/s from pre-to post-training (p < 0.002) on the knee extensor (pre = 100.0 +/- 15.9 W; post = 115.2 +/- 22.6 W), flexor (pre = 22.3 +/- 6.1 W; post = 29.1 +/- 7.9 W) and plantiflexor muscles (pre = 11.4 +/- 5.9 W; post = 21.2 +/- 4.2 W). MG presented greater average power at post-training than VG for knee extensor (20%) and flexor muscles (23%) (p < 0.039). There was main time effect of peak torque at 180 degrees/s for knee extensor (pre = 74.15 +/- 14.28 N.m/kg; post = 81.31 +/- 18.4 N.m/kg), flexor (pre = 43.01 +/- 12.43 N.m/kg; post = 48.3 +/- 9.11 N.m/kg) and plantiflexor muscles (pre = 29.2 +/- 13.76 N.m/kg; post = 36.87 +/- 9.7 N.m/kg) as well as average power (pre = 41.15 +/- 15.67 W; post = 48.42 +/- 11.8 W) and work (pre = 99.92 +/- 38.53 J; post = 117.03 +/- 25.56 J) on the knee flexor muscles (p < 0.046). MG improved timed up and go performance from pre-to post-training (pre = 10.0 +/- 0.32 s; post = 8.1 +/- 1.6 s, p = 0.001), whereas both groups improved 10 m-walk performance (pre = 1.33 +/- 0.25 s, post = 1.5 +/- 0.24 s; p = 0.003). Positive affect (2.64 +/- 0.02) and pleasure (15.8 +/- 0.6) for MG were greater than VG at post-training (2.36 +/- 0.03; p < 0.001; 14.4 +/- 0.5; p < 0.03). Therefore, regardless of the exercise intensity, exergame training improved muscle strength and functional capacity in pre-frail older women. However, positive affect and pleasure were reported only when older women practiced exergame with moderate exercise intensity.

[Title]    Is Kinect Training Superior to Conventional Balance Training for Healthy Older Adults to Improve Postural Control?
[Journal]  GAMES FOR HEALTH JOURNAL 8(1): 41-48.
[Abstract] Objective: To investigate the effects of balance training to improve postural control in adults older than 60. Our aim was to find out if Kinect training is superior to the conventional balance training in aspects of functional balance tests and posturography measurements testing postural stability through visual feedback. Materials and Methods: Thirty subjects participated in the Kinect training group (29 women and 1 man), practiced Kinect Adventures and Sports, 23 volunteers (22 women and 1 man) attended the conventional balance training, and 22 participants (18 women and 4 men) were allocated to the no-intervention control group. Both interventions lasted for 6 weeks, three times a week, and 30 minutes per session. The Four-Square Step Test, Functional Reach Test, Timed Up and Go test, Timed Up and Go cognitive dual-task test were measured, and for the assessment of the limit of stability (LOS), we used computerized posturography. Measurements were taken before the training at baseline and 6 weeks after (follow-up) the interventions. Statistical analysis was done through two-factor mixed analysis of variance and Newman-Keuls post hoc test. Results: Both training groups showed progress in the follow-up measurements; however, more statistically significant improvements were found in favor of the Kinect balance training group (Timed Up and Go test [P < 0.05], Timed Up and Go cognitive dual-task test [P < 0.05], Four-Square Step Test [P < 0.05], Functional Reach Test [P < 0.05], LOS movement velocity [P < 0.05]). Conclusion: Our results suggest that Kinect balance training may be a preferable and safe method for the healthy older adults to improve postural control and reduce the possibility of falling.

[Title]    Improving Walking, Muscle Strength, and Balance in the Elderly with an Exergame Using Kinect: A Randomized Controlled Trial.
[Journal]  GAMES FOR HEALTH JOURNAL 4(3): 161-167.
[Abstract] Background: Many issues prevent elderly individuals from exercising in daily life. There is a need for a system that allows elderly individuals to engage in exercise regularly at a low cost. We developed an exergame that uses a Kinect (R) sensor (Microsoft Corp., Redmond, WA) and conducted a randomized controlled trial of the effects of using this exergame on muscle strength and balance in healthy elderly individuals.Subjects and Methods: We enrolled 57 healthy elderly individuals and randomly divided them into an intervention group (n = 29) and a control group (n = 28) using a table of random numbers. All participants underwent gait analyses and were examined using the Berg Balance Scale (BBS), Functional Reach Test (FRT), and the 30-second chair-stand (CS-30) test before the intervention. Participants in the intervention group played the exergame once or twice a week, up to a total of 24 times. The tests were repeated after intervention, and the scores were compared with those obtained before intervention.Results: Our results indicated that walking, muscle strength, and motor function improved in participants in the intervention group. Decreased double standing time (P = 0.03), minimum foot clearance (P = 0.04), BBS scores (P < 0.01), CS-30 scores (P < 0.01), and FRT scores (P < 0.01) significantly improved in the intervention group compared with values in the control group.Conclusions: The Kinect-based exergame developed in this study was found to be effective in improving walking, muscular strength, and balance in elderly people.
[Answer]   YES
[Response] YES. The paper meets all the criteria:
1. The intervention targets include older people (healthy elderly individuals).
2. The intervention is an exergame using a Kinect sensor.
3. The study is a randomized controlled trial, and the results are reported.
4. The paper presents original data from the trial, not a meta-analysis, review, or feasibility analysis.

[Title]    Interactive Cognitive-Motor Step Training Improves Cognitive Risk Factors of Falling in Older Adults - A Randomized Controlled Trial.
[Journal]  PLOS ONE 10(12).
[Abstract] PurposeInteractive cognitive-motor training (ICMT) requires individuals to perform both gross motor movements and complex information processing. This study investigated the effectiveness of ICMT on cognitive functions associated with falls in older adults.MethodsA single-blinded randomized controlled trial was conducted in community-dwelling older adults (N = 90, mean age 81.5 +/- 7) without major cognitive impairment. Participants in the intervention group (IG) played four stepping games that required them to divide attention, inhibit irrelevant stimuli, switch between tasks, rotate objects and make rapid decisions. The recommended minimum dose was three 20-minute sessions per week over a period of 16 weeks unsupervised at home. Participants in the control group (CG) received an evidence- based brochure on fall prevention. Measures of processing speed, attention/executive function (EF), visuo-spatial ability, concerns about falling and depression were assessed before and after the intervention.ResultsEighty-one participants (90%) attended re-assessment. There were no improvements with respect to the Stroop Stepping Test (primary outcome) in the intervention group. Compared to the CG, the IG improved significantly in measures of processing speed, visuo-spatial ability and concern about falling. Significant interactions were observed for measures of EF and divided attention, indicating group differences varied for different levels of the covariate with larger improvements in IG participants with poorer baseline performance. The interaction for depression showed no change for the IG but an increase in the CG for those with low depressive symptoms at baseline. Additionally, low and high-adherer groups differed in their baseline performance and responded differently to the intervention. Compared to high adherers, low adherers improved more in processing speed and visual scanning while high-adherers improved more in tasks related to EF.ConclusionsThis study shows that unsupervised stepping ICMT led to improvements in specific cognitive functions associated with falls in older people. Low adherers improved in less complex functions while high-adherers improved in EF.
[Answer]   YES
[Response] YES. The paper meets the criteria for being about the use of exergames to prevent falls in the elderly:
1. The intervention targets older adults (community-dwelling older adults, mean age 81.5 ± 7).
2. The intervention involves an exergame (stepping games that require cognitive and motor tasks).
3. The study is a randomized controlled trial, and the results are reported.
4. The paper is not a meta-analysis, review, or feasibility analysis; it presents original data from a randomized controlled trial.

[Title]    Interactive balance training integrating sensor-based visual feedback of movement performance: a pilot study in older adults.
[Journal]  JOURNAL OF NEUROENGINEERING AND REHABILITATION 11.
[Abstract] Background: Wearable sensor technology can accurately measure body motion and provide incentive feedback during exercising. The aim of this pilot study was to evaluate the effectiveness and user experience of a balance training program in older adults integrating data from wearable sensors into a human-computer interface designed for interactive training.Methods: Senior living community residents (mean age 84.6) with confirmed fall risk were randomized to an intervention (IG, n = 17) or control group (CG, n = 16). The IG underwent 4 weeks (twice a week) of balance training including weight shifting and virtual obstacle crossing tasks with visual/auditory real-time joint movement feedback using wearable sensors. The CG received no intervention. Outcome measures included changes in center of mass (CoM) sway, ankle and hip joint sway measured during eyes open (EO) and eyes closed (EC) balance test at baseline and post-intervention. Ankle-hip postural coordination was quantified by a reciprocal compensatory index (RCI). Physical performance was quantified by the Alternate-Step-Test (AST), Timed-up-and-go (TUG), and gait assessment. User experience was measured by a standardized questionnaire.Results: After the intervention sway of CoM, hip, and ankle were reduced in the IG compared to the CG during both EO and EC condition (p = .007-.042). Improvement was obtained for AST (p = .037), TUG (p = .024), fast gait speed (p = . 010), but not normal gait speed (p = .264). Effect sizes were moderate for all outcomes. RCI did not change significantly. Users expressed a positive training experience including fun, safety, and helpfulness of sensor-feedback.Conclusions: Results of this proof-of-concept study suggest that older adults at risk of falling can benefit from the balance training program. Study findings may help to inform future exercise interventions integrating wearable sensors for guided game-based training in home-and community environments. Future studies should evaluate the added value of the proposed sensor-based training paradigm compared to traditional balance training programs and commercial exergames.
[Answer]   YES
[Response] YES. The paper meets the criteria for being about the use of exergames to prevent falls in the elderly:
1. The intervention targets older adults (mean age 84.6) with confirmed fall risk.
2. The intervention includes a balance training program with visual/auditory real-time joint movement feedback using wearable sensors, which can be considered an exergame.
3. The study is a randomized controlled trial, and the results are reported, including changes in center of mass sway, joint sway, and physical performance measures.
4. The paper is not a meta-analysis, review, or feasibility analysis; it presents original data from a pilot study.

[Title]    Stand Tall-A Virtual Translation of the Otago Exercise Program.
[Journal]  JOURNAL OF GERIATRIC PHYSICAL THERAPY 43(3): 120-127.
[Abstract] Background and Purpose: The Otago Exercise Program (OEP) is effective at preventing falls and fall-related injuries. The resources and personnel required for program delivery and challenges inherent in monitoring participant adherence and compliance pose significant barriers to increasing the number of older adults participating in the OEP. Alternative delivery systems using virtual platforms may pose a solution. The purposes of this article were to (1) describe the "Stand Tall" intervention, a virtual translation of the OEP; (2) describe Stand Tall participant characteristics and fall-related risk at baseline; and (3) identify changes in physical performance measures associated with fall risk from baseline to 8-week follow-up. Methods: This was a quasi-experimental, single-group, pretest-posttest design. Forty-two older adults at risk for falls were recruited. Participants were oriented to Stand Tall by study personnel and then monitored and progressed virtually with face to face check-ins. Participants independently logged in and completed a prescribed a set of exercises 3 times a week for 30 minutes for a total of 8 weeks. Results and Discussion: The average participant age was 75.0 (9.1) years and self-reported 2.3 (1.7) chronic conditions. There were more men than women (52.4%) in the study. Participants were primarily non-Hispanic white (90.5%), had a college education (61.9), 40% reported falling in the past 6 months, and 60% screened positive for mild cognitive impairment. Participants were beginning to show decline in function with average single-leg stance less than 10 seconds and 30-second chair rise scores below normative values. Participants demonstrated high adherence rates (>88%) and significant improvements in physical performance measures associated with fall risk. These results may be limited to a less frail population and the study was not powered to demonstrate a reduction in falls. Conclusions: Results support that an avatar-delivered version of the OEP is effective, feasible, viable, and enjoyable for community-dwelling older adults. These types of platforms should be considered as potential mechanisms to increase availability of fall prevention programs.
[Answer]   YES
[Response] NO. The paper describes a virtual translation of the Otago Exercise Program (OEP) called "Stand Tall," which is aimed at preventing falls in older adults. However, the study does not meet all the specified criteria for judgment:. 1. The intervention targets older people: YES
2. The intervention should be an exergame: UNCERTAIN (The intervention is described as a virtual platform with an avatar, but it is not explicitly stated to be an exergame, virtual reality, or video game. It appears to be a digital translation of a traditional exercise program.)
3. The paper should include randomized controlled trials, and the results should be reported: NO (The study design is a quasi-experimental, single-group, pretest-posttest design, not a randomized controlled trial.). Given these points, the paper does not fully meet the criteria, particularly because it lacks a randomized controlled trial and it is not clear if the intervention qualifies as an exergame. Therefore, the answer is "NO."

[Title]    A machine learning approach to evaluate the impact of virtual balance/cognitive training on fall risk in older women.
[Journal]  FRONTIERS IN COMPUTATIONAL NEUROSCIENCE 18.
[Abstract] Introduction: Novel technologies based on virtual reality (VR) are creating attractive virtual environments with high ecological value, used both in basic/clinical neuroscience and modern medical practice. The study aimed to evaluate the effects of VR-based training in an elderly population. Materials and methods: The study included 36 women over the age of 60, who were randomly divided into two groups subjected to balance-strength and balance-cognitive training. The research applied both conventional clinical tests, such as (a) the Timed Up and Go test, (b) the five-times sit-to-stand test, and (c) the posturographic exam with the Romberg test with eyes open and closed. Training in both groups was conducted for 10 sessions and embraced exercises on a bicycle ergometer and exercises using non-immersive VR created by the ActivLife platform. Machine learning methods with a k-nearest neighbors classifier, which are very effective and popular, were proposed to statistically evaluate the differences in training effects in the two groups. Results and conclusion: The study showed that training using VR brought beneficial improvement in clinical tests and changes in the pattern of posturographic trajectories were observed. An important finding of the research was a statistically significant reduction in the risk of falls in the study population. The use of virtual environments in exercise/training has great potential in promoting healthy aging and preventing balance loss and falls among seniors.
[Answer]   YES
[Response] YES. The paper meets the criteria for being about the use of exergames to prevent falls in the elderly:
1. The intervention targets older women (age 60 and above).
2. The intervention includes virtual reality (VR) training, which is a form of exergame.
3. The study is a randomized controlled trial, and the results are reported, showing a statistically significant reduction in the risk of falls.
4. The paper presents original data from the trial, not a meta-analysis, review, or feasibility analysis.

[Title]    The effectiveness and cost-effectiveness of strength and balance Exergames to reduce falls risk for people aged 55years and older in UK assisted living facilities: a multi-centre, cluster randomised controlled trial.
[Journal]  BMC MEDICINE 17.
[Abstract] BackgroundFalls are the leading cause of fatal and non-fatal unintentional injuries in older people. The use of Exergames (active, gamified video-based exercises) is a possible innovative, community-based approach. This study aimed to determine the effectiveness of a tailored OTAGO/FaME-based strength and balance Exergame programme for improving balance, maintaining function and reducing falls risk in older people.MethodsA two-arm cluster randomised controlled trial recruiting adults aged 55years and older living in 18 assisted living (sheltered housing) facilities (clusters) in the UK. Standard care (physiotherapy advice and leaflet) was compared to a tailored 12-week strength and balance Exergame programme, supported by physiotherapists or trained assistants. Complete case analysis (intention-to-treat) was used to compare the Berg Balance Scale (BBS) at baseline and at 12weeks. Secondary outcomes included fear of falling, mobility, fall risk, pain, mood, fatigue, cognition, healthcare utilisation and health-related quality of life, and self-reported physical activity and falls.ResultsEighteen clusters were randomised (9 to each arm) with 56 participants allocated to the intervention and 50 to the control (78% female, mean age 78years). Fourteen participants withdrew over the 12weeks (both arms), mainly for ill health. There was an adjusted mean improvement in balance (BBS) of 6.2 (95% CI 2.4 to 10.0) and reduced fear of falling (p=0.007) and pain (p=0.02) in the Exergame group. Mean attendance at sessions was 69% (mean exercising time of 33min/week). Twenty-four percent of the control group and 20% of the Exergame group fell over the trial period. The change in fall rates significantly favoured the intervention (incident rate ratio 0.31 (95% CI 0.16 to 0.62, p=0.001)). The point estimate of the incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER) was 15,209.80 per quality-adjusted life year (QALY). Using 10,000 bootstrap replications, at the lower bound of the NICE threshold of 20,000 per QALY, there was a 61% probability of Exergames being cost-effective, rising to 73% at the upper bound of 30,000 pound per QALY.ConclusionsExergames, as delivered in this trial, improve balance, pain and fear of falling and are a cost-effective fall prevention strategy in assisted living facilities for people aged 55years or older.

[Title]    Exergame and cognitive training for preventing falls in community-dwelling older people: a randomized controlled trial.
[Journal]  NATURE MEDICINE 30(1).
[Abstract] Exergame training, in which video games are used to promote exercise, can be tailored to address cognitive and physical risk factors for falls and is a promising method for fall prevention in older people. Here, we performed a randomized clinical trial using the smart +/- step gaming system to examine the effectiveness of two home-based computer game interventions, seated cognitive training and step exergame training, for fall prevention in community-dwelling older people, as compared with a minimal-intervention control group. Participants aged 65 years or older (n = 769, 71% female) living independently in the community were randomized to one of three arms: (1) cognitive training using a computerized touchpad while seated, (2) exergame step training on a computerized mat or (3) control (provided with an education booklet on healthy ageing and fall prevention). The rate of falls reported monthly over 12 months-the primary outcome of the trial-was significantly reduced in the exergame training group compared with the control group (incidence rate ratio = 0.74, 95% confidence interval = 0.56-0.98), but was not statistically different between the cognitive training and control groups (incidence rate ratio = 0.86, 95% confidence interval = 0.65-1.12). No beneficial effects of the interventions were found for secondary outcomes of physical and cognitive function, and no serious intervention-related adverse events were reported. The results of this trial support the use of exergame step training for preventing falls in community-dwelling older people. As this intervention can be conducted at home and requires only minimal equipment, it has the potential for scalability as a public health intervention to address the increasing problem of falls and fall-related injuries. Australian and New Zealand Clinical Trial Registry identifier: ACTRN12616001325493.In a randomized clinical trial enrolling older people living in a community setting, exergame step training on a computerized mat, but not seated cognitive training, decreased the rate of falls over the course of a year, as compared to a control group provided with an education booklet on healthy aging and fall prevention.

[Title]    Effect of cognitive-only and cognitive-motor training on preventing falls in community-dwelling older people: protocol for the smart±step randomised controlled trial.
[Journal]  BMJ OPEN 9(8).
[Abstract] Background Physical and cognitive impairments are important risk factors for falls in older people. However, no studies have been adequately powered to examine whether cognitive or cognitive-motor training can prevent falls in older people. This is despite good evidence of improvements in fall-related cognitive and physical functions following both intervention types. This manuscript describes the study protocol for a three-arm randomised controlled trial to evaluate the effectiveness of home-based cognitive and cognitive-motor training interventions, compared to a minimal-intervention control group, in preventing falls in older people. This trial was prospectively registered with the Australia New Zealand Clinical Trial Registry, number ACTRN12616001325493.Methods and analysis Community-dwelling adults aged 65 years and over, residing in Sydney Australia, will be recruited. Participants (n=750) will be randomly allocated to (1) cognitive-only training, (2) cognitive-motor training or (3) control groups. Both training interventions involve the use of the smartstephome-based computerised game playing system for a recommended 120min/week for 12 months. Cognitive training group participants will use a desktop electronic touch pad to play games with the smartstepsystem while seated and using both hands. The cognitive-motor training group participants will use a wireless electronic floor step mat that requires accurate stepping using both legs for playing the same smart +/- step games, hence incorporating balance exercises. All groups will receive an education booklet on fall prevention. The primary outcome will be rate of falls, reported by monthly diaries during the 12-month duration of the study and analysis will be by intention-to-treat. Secondary outcomes include the proportion of fallers, physical and cognitive performance in 300 participants, and brain structure and function in 105 participants who will undertake MRI scans at baseline and 6 months. Cost-effectiveness will be determined using intervention and health service costs.Ethics and dissemination Ethical approval was obtained from UNSW Ethics Committee in September 2015 (ref number HC15203). Outcomes will be disseminated through publication in peer-reviewed journals and presentations at international conferences.Trial registration number ACTRN12616001325493
[Answer]   YES
[Response] YES. The paper describes a randomized controlled trial (RCT) that aims to evaluate the effectiveness of home-based cognitive and cognitive-motor training interventions in preventing falls in community-dwelling older people. The intervention involves the use of a computerized game-playing system, which qualifies as an exergame, especially for the cognitive-motor training group, where participants use a wireless electronic floor step mat that requires accurate stepping, thus incorporating balance exercises. The primary outcome is the rate of falls, and the study includes 750 participants aged 65 years and over. Therefore, the paper meets all the specified criteria.

[Title]    Improved Walking Through an Aperture in a Virtual Environment Transfers to a Real Environment: Introduction of Enriched Feedback and Gradual Increase in Task Difficulty.
[Journal]  FRONTIERS IN SPORTS AND ACTIVE LIVING 4.
[Abstract] Virtual reality (VR) could be used to set up a training protocol to improve one's collision-avoidance behavior. In our previous study, we developed a VR system for training older individuals to walk through an aperture in a manner that is both safe (i.e., no collision) and efficient (i.e., no exaggerated behavior to ensure collision avoidance). In the present study, we made several modifications to the VR system in terms of enriched feedback (vibratory stimulation for virtual collisions and the addition of positive feedback for successful trials) and gradual increase in task difficulty during training to strengthen the skill transfer. Nineteen older adults (74.4 +/- 5.3 years of age) and 21 younger adults (25.1 +/- 5.0 years of age) participated. They were randomly assigned to one of two training groups: the intervention group (older: n = 10; younger: n = 10) or the control group (older: n = 11; younger: n = 9). The experiment consisted of pre- and post-training tests in a real environment and training in a VR environment. During training, participants held a horizontal bar while stepping in place as if a VR image on the screen were moving in response to their stepping. Participants in the intervention group tried to pass a narrow aperture without collision while attempting to minimize their body rotation to avoid collision as much as possible. The criterion upon which the collision-avoidance behavior was regarded as successful became incrementally more demanding as participants successfully met the previous criterion. Participants in the control group passed through a very wide aperture, so that collision-avoidance behavior was unnecessary. A comparison between pre- and post-training test performances showed that, for both older and younger adults in the intervention group, the spatial margins became significantly smaller, while the success rate remained unchanged. For those in the control group, neither the spatial margin nor the success rate was improved. These results suggest that the three modifications made for the VR system contributed to improvement of the system and helped participants transfer the behavior learned from the VR environment to real walking.
[Answer]   YES
[Response] YES. The paper meets the criteria for being about the use of exergames to prevent falls in the elderly:. 1. Intervention Targets Include Older People: The study includes 19 older adults (74.4 ± 5.3 years of age).
2. Intervention is an Exergame: The intervention involves a virtual reality (VR) system where participants train to walk through an aperture, which is a form of exergame.
3. Randomized Controlled Trial with Reported Results: The study uses a randomized controlled trial design, with participants randomly assigned to either the intervention group or the control group. The results are reported, showing that the spatial margins became significantly smaller for both older and younger adults in the intervention group, while the success rate remained unchanged.. Therefore, the paper is about the use of exergames to prevent falls in the elderly.

[Title]    Interactive Game-Based Platform System for Assessing and Improving Posture Control in the Elderly.
[Journal]  BIOENGINEERING-BASEL 10(11).
[Abstract] Inadequate response to balance perturbations lead to posture instability in the elderly. The fall risks are increased by a reduced capacity to control the center of pressure (COP) displacement within the safety limit of the supporting base. This study developed an interactive evaluation and training platform. The system incorporated a computerized program with instantaneous force plate evaluation. Ten young subjects underwent a baseline evaluation and twenty-nine community-dwelling elderly received pre- and post-intervention testing. The ability to reach the stability limit was assessed by measuring the maximum voluntary excursion of the COP in anterior-posterior and medial-lateral directions. Functional mobility tests including Berg Balance Scale, Timed-Up-and-Go and functional reach were used as functional outcomes. The experimental group (n = 15) received a 40 min intervention three times a week for six weeks. The interactive game-based training focused on multi-directional weight shifting by tracing a COPcontrolled target to challenge an individual's stability limit. The control group (n = 14) maintained daily activities as usual. The young group revealed a superior COP displacement through active ankle control than the elderly, especially in the anterior-posterior direction. The experimental group improved their COP displacement control more in the medial-lateral direction due to the predominant side-to-side gameplay movement. The functional outcome measures were also significantly improved after training. Using the COPcontrolled game-based program, the stability limit was challenged to facilitate dynamic posture control by an incremental increase in self-initiated perturbations. The platform system could assist in transferring the immediate training effects into daily functional mobility in the elderly.
[Answer]   YES
[Response] YES. The paper meets the criteria for being about the use of exergames to prevent falls in the elderly:
1. The intervention targets include older people (community-dwelling elderly).
2. The intervention is an exergame, specifically an interactive game-based training that focuses on multi-directional weight shifting.
3. The study includes a randomized controlled trial, with an experimental group and a control group, and the results are reported.
4. The paper is not a meta-analysis, review, or feasibility analysis; it presents original data from the trial.

[Title]    The effect of virtual reality training on the fall-related risk factors of the elderly people in the nursing home.
[Journal]  Chinese Journal of Rehabilitation Medicine 33(6): 687-692.
[Abstract] Objective: To investigate the effect of virtual reality(VR) training on the fall-related risk factors of the elderly people in the nursing home. Method: Sixty elderly people in Nanjing Jiangning Muchunyuan Nursing Home were divided into VR group (30 cases) and control group (30 cases) using a random number table. The control group received routine fall prevention training, while the VR group received virtual reality training. Both groups were given 12 weeks of training,50 minutes per times and 3 times per week. The balance function assessment system,the timed up and go test(TUGT), the 30-second chair stand test(30sCST), the Tinetti gait score and the modified falls efficacy scale (MFES) were used to assess the static balance function,the dynamic balance function, the strength of lower limbs, the gait function and the modified falls efficacy. The frequency of falls in the next one year was recorded. Result: All parameters and assessments after the training in both groups were significantly more improved than those before the training(P<0.05),and after the training, the static balance function parameters,TUGT,30sCST, Tinetti gait score and MFES results in the VR group were significantly better than those in the control group (P<0.05). The frequency of falls after the training in both groups were significantly less than those before the training(P<0.05),and the frequency of falls was less in the VR group than in the control group(P<0.05). Conclusion: Virtual reality training can effectively improve the fall-related risk factors including the balance function,the strength of lower limbs,the gait function,and the modified falls efficacy of the elderly people in the nursing home,and reduce their frequency of falls with better effect than the routine fall prevention training.
[Answer]   YES
[Response] YES. The paper meets all the criteria:
1. The intervention targets older people in a nursing home.
2. The intervention is virtual reality (VR) training, which is a form of exergame.
3. The study is a randomized controlled trial, and the results are reported.

[Title]    Exergames to Improve the Mobility of Long-Term Care Residents: A Cluster Randomized Controlled Trial.
[Journal]  GAMES FOR HEALTH JOURNAL 7(1): 37-42.
[Abstract] Objective: Finding suitable and engaging ways for older people living in long-term care (LTC) to engage in physical activity, to maintain function is challenging. There is a need to explore the use of exergames for LTC residents who have mobility and cognitive impairments. We investigated the effect of a group-based Xbox Kinect (Microsoft Corp., Redmond, WA) exergame program on mobility in LTC residents with and without cognitive impairment.Methods: Facilities were randomly assigned to the intervention (four facilities, n=29, aged 84.7 +/- 7.4 years) or control group (five facilities, n=36, aged 85.8 +/- 7.2 years). The intervention group played Xbox Kinect exergames twice weekly for 8 weeks. The control group continued usual activities. The primary outcome measure was mobility, assessed pre- and postintervention using the de Morton Mobility Index (DEMMI).Results: DEMMI scores improved in residents who played exergames, although this did not reach significance (P=0.06). There was no interaction between cognition scores and DEMMI scores (P=0.86). Participants attended an average of 55% of scheduled exergames sessions.Conclusion: The trend toward improvement in mobility, as well as attendance rates indicate that the Xbox Kinect exergames were engaging for a proportion of residents. On this basis, further exergames development for LTC residents warrants attention.
[Answer]   YES
[Response] YES. The paper meets all the criteria for being about the use of exergames to prevent falls in the elderly:
1. The intervention targets older people living in long-term care (LTC) facilities.
2. The intervention involves an exergame, specifically the Xbox Kinect.
3. The study is a cluster randomized controlled trial, and the results are reported.
4. The paper is not a meta-analysis, review, or feasibility analysis; it presents original data from a randomized controlled trial.. While the primary outcome measure is mobility, improving mobility is closely related to preventing falls, making this study relevant to the use of exergames to prevent falls in the elderly.

[Title]    Effects of Mat Exergame-Based Multicomponent Training on the Standing Balance of Community-Dwelling Older Adults With and Without Fall Risk.
[Journal]  GAMES FOR HEALTH JOURNAL 11(3): 186-192.
[Abstract] Objective: Exergames may enhance postural stability and prevent falls. This study investigated the effects of mat exergame-based multicomponent training on the static and dynamic standing balance capacities of community-dwelling older adults.Materials and Methods: Study participants comprised 34 community-dwelling older adults who were assigned into the high-risk group (yes to at least one question) or low-risk group (no to all three questions) based on the 3-item subset of a fall risk questionnaire. A 2-hour Stampede mat exergaming, including resistance, aerobics, flexibility, and balance training, was completed weekly for 3 months. The postural stability test, fall risk test, limits of stability (LOS) test, and the modified clinical test of sensory interaction and balance were conducted using the Biodex Balance System SD before and after the intervention. Intervention effects within and between groups were compared.Results: After the intervention, significant improvements in the fall risk index (FRI, P = 0.007) and overall stability index (OSI, P = 0.008) were observed in the high-risk group (n = 18; mean age, 71.0 +/- 4.7 years). Medium effect sizes (ESs) were noted in the low-risk group (n = 16; mean age, 70.8 +/- 4.4 years) for the FRI (ES = 0.35), OSI (ES = 0.43), and LOS (ES = 0.40-0.45). The change scores were not different between groups.Conclusion: Mat exergame-based multicomponent training is effective in enhancing the standing balance. Exergame-based intervention is recommended for balance training among older adults.

[Title]    Using exergame-based exercise to prevent and postpone the loss of muscle mass, muscle strength, cognition, and functional performance among elders in rural long-term care facilities: A protocol for a randomized controlled trial.
[Journal]  FRONTIERS IN MEDICINE 9.
[Abstract] Objective: Elderly individuals in long-term care facilities (LTCFs) have a higher prevalence of sarcopenia than those in the community. Exercise is the gold standard for preventing and treating sarcopenia. Regarding exercise, multicomponent exercises, including progressive resistance training (PRT), are beneficial. However, developing routine, structured exercise programs for the elderly in LTCFs is difficult because of a shortage of healthcare providers, particularly in rural regions. Exergame-based exercises can increase a player's motivation and reduce staff time for an intervention. Nintendo Switch RingFit Adventure (RFA) is a novel exergame that combines resistance, aerobic, and balance exercises. In this study, we aim to investigate the clinical effectiveness of RFA on muscle and functional performance parameters among the elderly in LTCFs. Methods: The EXPPLORE (using EXergame to Prevent and Postpone the LOss of muscle mass, muscle strength, and functional performance in Rural Elders) trial is a single-center randomized controlled trial involving elderly individuals (>= 60 years) living in LTCFs in rural southern Taiwan. The participants will be equally randomized to the intervention group (exergame-based exercise plus standard care) or the control group (standard care alone). Both groups will receive standard care except that the intervention group will receive exergame-based exercises at the time previously scheduled for sedentary activities in the LTCFs. The exergame-based exercise will be performed using RFA in the sitting position with a specialized design, including arm fit skills and knee assist mode. Each session of the exercise lasts 30 mins and will be performed two times per week for 12 weeks. The primary outcomes will be the osteoporotic fracture index, appendicular skeletal muscle mass index, dominant handgrip strength, and gait speed. Meanwhile, the secondary outcomes will be the dexterity and agility, muscle strength and thickness, range of motion of the joints of the dominant upper extremity, Kihon checklist, Medical Outcomes Study 36-Item Short-Form Health Survey, and Brain Health Test. Discussion: This trial will provide valuable knowledge on whether exergames using RFA can counteract physical decline and improve quality of life and cognition among the elderly in LTCFs.
[Answer]   YES
[Response] YES. The paper meets the criteria for being about the use of exergames to prevent falls in the elderly:
1. Target Population: The intervention targets older people (>= 60 years) living in long-term care facilities.
2. Intervention Type: The intervention is an exergame, specifically the Nintendo Switch RingFit Adventure (RFA), which combines resistance, aerobic, and balance exercises.
3. Study Design: The study is a randomized controlled trial, with participants randomized to either the intervention group (exergame-based exercise plus standard care) or the control group (standard care alone).
4. Results Reporting: Although the abstract does not provide the results, it clearly outlines the primary and secondary outcomes that will be measured, indicating that the results will be reported.. Therefore, the paper is about the use of exergames to prevent falls in the elderly.

[Title]    Wii Fit Exercise's Effects on Muscle Strength and Fear of Falling in Older Adults With Alzheimer Disease: A Randomized Controlled Trial.
[Journal]  JOURNAL OF AGING AND PHYSICAL ACTIVITY.
[Abstract] Purpose: This study aimed to investigate how Wii Fit exercises affect muscle strength and fear of falling in older adults with Alzheimer's disease. Method: The study included a total of 32 volunteers with Alzheimer's disease, aged 65-80 years. These participants were divided into two groups: the exercise group and the control group. The exercise group received a 30-min (one session) twice-weekly exercise program for 6 weeks with games selected from different categories, such as balance and aerobic exercises, with the Nintendo Wii virtual reality device. During this period, the control group did not receive any treatment, and routine medical treatments continued. At baseline and 6 weeks later, Mini-Mental State Examination, knee extension muscle strength, Timed Up and Go Test, and Tinetti Fall Efficacy Scale results were recorded in the exercise and control groups. Results: In intragroup comparison, a statistically significant difference was found in all tests (muscle strength, Timed Up and Go Test, and Tinetti Fall Efficacy Scale) in the exercise group after the exercise program (p < .05), while no significant difference was found in the control group (p > .05). According to the interaction of group and time in the intergroup comparison, there was no difference between the groups (exercise and control group) in muscle strength and Timed Up and Go Test (p > .05), but there was a difference in Tinetti Fall Efficacy Scale (p < .05). Conclusions: This randomized controlled trial supports the claim that Wii Fit exercises can reduce the fear of falling in older adults with Alzheimer's disease.

[Title]    Recov-R: Evaluation of a Home-Based Tailored Exergame System to Reduce Fall Risk in Seniors.
[Journal]  ACM TRANSACTIONS ON COMPUTER-HUMAN INTERACTION 26(4).
[Abstract] Rehabilitation has proven effective to significantly reduce fall risk in seniors; however, low adherence to home rehabilitation and a lack of feedback on performance and progress indicate that seniors might not receive the amount of therapy necessary to reduce their risk of falling. We present a tailored exergame system for the home (called Recov-R) to motivate seniors to exercise and facilitate effective recovery by promoting optimal quality of movement during exercise. Based on an 8-week field study, with 38 participants, we present results on the use of the Recov-R system, versus standard care, in the home. Our findings suggest that the use of the system can increase adherence to exercise and reduce fall risk by improving outcomes of physical function-mobility and balance. We also highlight opportunities, based on these results, for the design of effective exergame technologies for musculoskeletal rehabilitation in the home.
[Answer]   YES
[Response] YES. The paper meets the criteria for being about the use of exergames to prevent falls in the elderly:
1. The intervention targets older people (seniors).
2. The intervention is an exergame (Recov-R, a tailored exergame system).
3. The study includes a randomized controlled trial, comparing the Recov-R system to standard care, and reports the results.
4. The paper presents original data from an 8-week field study with 38 participants, rather than being a meta-analysis, review, or feasibility analysis.

[Title]    Video and computer-based interactive exercises are safe and improve task-specific balance in geriatric and neurological rehabilitation: a randomised trial.
[Journal]  JOURNAL OF PHYSIOTHERAPY 62(1): 20-28.
[Abstract] Question: Does adding video/computer-based interactive exercises to inpatient geriatric and neurological rehabilitation improve mobility outcomes? Is it feasible and safe? Design: Randomised trial. Participants: Fifty-eight rehabilitation inpatients. Intervention: Physiotherapist-prescribed, tailored, video/computer-based interactive exercises for 1 hour on weekdays, mainly involving stepping and weight-shifting exercises. Outcome measures: The primary outcome was the Short Physical Performance Battery (0 to 3) at 2 weeks. Secondary outcomes were: Maximal Balance Range (mm); Step Test (step count); Rivermead Mobility Index (0 to 15); activity levels; Activity Measure for Post Acute Care Basic Mobility (18 to 72) and Daily Activity (15 to 60); Falls Efficacy Scale (10 to 40), ED5D utility score (0 to 1); Reintegration to Normal Living Index (0 to 100); System Usability Scale (0 to 100) and Physical Activity Enjoyment Scale (0 to 126). Safety was determined from adverse events during intervention. Results: At 2 weeks the between-group difference in the primary outcome (0.1, 95% CI -0.2 to 0.3) was not statistically significant. The intervention group performed significantly better than usual care for Maximal Balance Range (38 mm difference after baseline adjustment, 95% CI 6 to 69). Other secondary outcomes were not statistically significant. Fifty-eight (55%) of the eligible patients agreed to participate, 25/29 (86%) completed the intervention and 10 (39%) attended > 70% of sessions, with a mean of 5.6 sessions (SD 3.3) attended and overall average duration of 4.5 hours (SD 3.1). Average scores were 62 (SD 21) for the System Usability Scale and 62 (SD 8) for the Physical Activity Enjoyment Scale. There were no adverse events. Conclusion: The addition of video/computer-based interactive exercises to usual rehabilitation is a safe and feasible way to increase exercise dose, but is not suitable for all. Adding the exercises to usual rehabilitation resulted in task-specific improvements in balance but not overallmobility. Registration: ACTRN12613000610730.

[Journal]  MATURITAS 111: 53-60.
[Abstract] Background: Frailty is one of the key geriatric syndromes and is related to the loss of functional independence. However, the practice of physical training (PT) combined with protein supplementation (PS) may improve musculoskeletal function (MF).Objective: To verify the effect of PT using 'exergames' with or without PS on MF, nutritional status, and risk of falls in pre-frail older women.Method: The protocol is for a randomized controlled clinical trial with a sample of pre-frail older women, divided into 5 groups: control group; PT using exergames; PS; PT using exergames combined with PS; PT using exergames combined with isoenergetic supplementation. The primary outcomes will be: the strength and power of the lower limbs, assessed by isokinetic dynamometer and the sit-and-stand test carried out 5 times; muscle architecture, assessed by ultrasound; body composition, assessed by anthropometric measurements, bioelectrical impedance and dual energy X-ray absorptiometry; and functional mobility and risk of falls, assessed using the Timed-Up and Go test. The secondary outcomes will be: centre of pressure (CoP), assessed using a force plate; and fear of falling, assessed using the Falls Efficacy Scale - International, Brazil. PT using exergames with a gradual increase in the mass weighted vest will be carried out twice a week for 50 min over 3 months. The supplements will be ingested 5 days a week for 3 months. All outcomes will be assessed before and after 3 months.Discussion: The WiiProtein study will be the first clinical trial to examine the effects of PT using exergames with progressive resistance, which may or may not be combined with PS, on MF, nutritional status, and risk of falls in pre-frail older women.

[Title]    A Wii Bit of Fun: A Novel Platform to Deliver Effective Balance Training to Older Adults.
[Journal]  GAMES FOR HEALTH JOURNAL 4(6): 423-433.
[Abstract] Background: Falls and fall-related injuries are symptomatic of an aging population. This study aimed to design, develop, and deliver a novel method of balance training, using an interactive game-based system to promote engagement, with the inclusion of older adults at both high and low risk of experiencing a fall. Study Design: Eighty-two older adults (65 years of age and older) were recruited from sheltered accommodation and local activity groups. Forty volunteers were randomly selected and received 5 weeks of balance game training (5 males, 35 females; mean, 77.186.59 years), whereas the remaining control participants recorded levels of physical activity (20 males, 22 females; mean, 76.627.28 years). The effect of balance game training was measured on levels of functional balance and balance confidence in individuals with and without quantifiable balance impairments. Results: Balance game training had a significant effect on levels of functional balance and balance confidence (P<0.05). This was further demonstrated in participants who were deemed at high risk of falls. The overall pattern of results suggests the training program is effective and suitable for individuals at all levels of ability and may therefore play a role in reducing the risk of falls. Conclusions: Commercial hardware can be modified to deliver engaging methods of effective balance assessment and training for the older population.

[Title]    Effects of an 8-Week Virtual Reality Training Program on Pain, Fall Risk, and Quality of Life in Elderly Women with Chronic Low Back Pain: Double-Blind Randomized Clinical Trial.
[Journal]  GAMES FOR HEALTH JOURNAL 11(2): 85-92.
[Abstract] Objective: Low back pain (LBP) and falls are among the major problems experienced by the elderly population. The present study investigated the effectiveness of an 8-week virtual reality training (VRT) program in helping relieve pain, minimize fall risk, and improve quality of life (QoL) in elderly women suffering from chronic LBP (CLBP).Materials and Methods: Twenty-five elderly women (VRT/intervention group = 13, control group = 12) with CLBP and aged 65 to 75 years were recruited. The VRT involved three 30-minute weekly sessions of exercises that were carried out using the Xbox Kinect headset. Pain intensity, fall risk, and QoL were assessed via the Visual Analog Scale, the Biodex Balance System, and the 36-Item Short Form Health Survey, respectively.Results: The outcomes of a one-way analysis of covariance indicated that the pain intensity score of the intervention group significantly decreased after participation in the VRT program (P = 0.001). The intervention group also showed reduced fall risk (P = 0.001) and elevated QoL (P = 0.001).Conclusion: The results confirmed that the VRT program can be regarded as a valid therapeutic intervention that helps reduce patients' symptoms and increase the effectiveness of exercises in the elderly by teaching pain-related insight as well as enhancing QoL and reduce fall risk through various movements.

[Title]    Effects of Kinect exergames on balance training among community older adults A randomized controlled trial.
[Journal]  MEDICINE 99(28).
[Abstract] Background: Recent years have witnessed wide applications of exergames to balance training among the older adults. However, research concerning balance training with the use of Kinect for Xbox has remained scarce. While previous studies have shown the positive effects of exergames on improving balance and preventing falling among the older adults, there has been a paucity of empirical evidence supporting the superiority of Kinect exercise to conventional exercise over balance training among the older adults. Therefore, this study aimed to compare the feasibility, safety, and effectiveness of Kinect exercise against conventional exercise over balance training among the community older adults. Method: A total of 20 participants were randomly assigned to the Kinect Exercise Group (N = 10) or the Conventional Exercise Group (N = 10) for a 5-week balance training (45 minutes a time, 2 times a week). Assessor blinding was employed to assess the participants' performance before and after the treatment, including 30-Second Chair Stand Test (30-sec CST), Timed Up and Go (TUG), Functional Reach Test (FRT), and One-Leg Stance Test (OLST) respectively with eyes open and closed.Subjective feelingof the intensity ofpain and side effectswererecordedthroughout the investigation period. Nonparametric statistics was used for data analysis. Results: Within-group comparison between the pre-test and post-test indicated that significant differences existed in all of the 5 tests (30-sec CST, TUG, FRT, OLST with eyes open, and OLST with eyes closed) in the Kinect exercise group. To the Conventional exercise group, however, significant differences were only observed in 30-sec CST, FRT and OLST with eyes open. With regard to between-group comparison, significant differences were only found in FRT. Conclusion: Such results indicated that both treatments were helpful in improving the participants' balance performance, that Kinect exercise was more effective in terms of overall balance ability, and that Kinect exercise was particularly beneficial to functional reach enhancement in comparison with traditional exercise. Kinect exercise could be a feasible, safe, and effective alternative for dynamic balance training among older adults.

[Title]    Comparison of the effects of virtual reality-based balance exercises and conventional exercises on balance and fall risk in older adults living in nursing homes in Turkey.
[Journal]  PHYSIOTHERAPY THEORY AND PRACTICE 32(3): 191-201.
[Abstract] Objectives: There is limited information on effective balance training techniques including virtual reality (VR)-based balance exercises in residential settings and no studies have been designed to compare the effects of VR-based balance exercises with conventional balance exercises in older adults living in nursing homes in Turkey. The objective of our study was to investigate the effects of VR-based balance exercises on balance and fall risk in comparison to conventional balance exercises in older adults living in nursing homes. Methods: A total sample of 18 subjects (65-82 years of age) with fall history who were randomly assigned to either the VR group (Group 1, n = 7) or the conventional exercise group (Group 2, n = 11) completed the exercise training. Results: In both groups, Berg balance score (BBS), timed up & go duration, and left leg stance and tandem stance duration with eyes closed significantly improved with time (p < 0.05), but changes were similar in both groups (p > 0.05) after training, indicating that neither the exercise method was superior. Conclusion: Similar improvements were found in balance and fall risk with VR-based balance training and conventional balance training in older adults living in the nursing home. Both exercise trainings can be preferable by health care professionals considering fall prevention. Appropriate patient selection is essential.

[Title]    The effectiveness of virtual reality exercise games on balance functions and fear of falling in women with osteoporosis.
[Journal]  RHEUMATOLOGY INTERNATIONAL 44(6): 1071-1076.
[Abstract] To investigate and compare the effectiveness of Nintendo Wii games and home exercises on balance functions in patients with osteoporosis, an important disease adversely affecting balance functions. The patients included in the study were randomized into two groups the Wii exercise group (n = 30) and the home exercise group (n = 30). Wii exercise group performed balance exercises with a Nintendo Wii device and balance board three times a week for 12 weeks under the supervision of a physiotherapist in the hospital, and home exercise group was prescribed home exercises three days a week for 12 weeks. Balance functions were evaluated with the timed up-and-go-test and Berg Balance Scale, and the fall risk was evaluated with the Falls Efficacy Scale at the beginning and end of 12 weeks of treatment. Comparison of pre- and post-treatment timed up-and-go-test, Berg Balance Scale, and Falls Efficacy Scale results in both groups revealed statistically significant improvements (p = 0.001; p < 0.05). Furthermore, post-treatment test scores between the two groups demonstrated a significant enhancement in Wii exercise group regarding the Berg Balance Scale score (Mean +/- SD 52.9 +/- 3.63) (p = 0.001; p < 0.05). Within the osteoporotic population, balance functions serve as robust predictors of fall risk. Improvement in balance functions is crucial for the prevention of falls and subsequent osteoporotic fractures. In our study, we found that balance exercises performed with Wii games are effective in improving balance functions in patients with osteoporosis.

[Title]    Effects of interactive video-game-based exercise on balance in older adults with mild-to-moderate Parkinson's disease.
[Journal]  JOURNAL OF NEUROENGINEERING AND REHABILITATION 17(1).
[Abstract] Background: This study aimed to evaluate the effectiveness of a customized interactive video game-based (IVGB) training on balance in older adults with mild-to-moderate Parkinson's disease (PD).Methods: In this 12-week crossover trial, PD patients >= 65 years of age were randomly divided into Group A (a 6-week intervention phase followed by a 6-week control phase) and Group B (a 6-week control phase followed by a 6-week intervention phase). Participants received IVGB exercise training during the intervention phase and no exercise during the control phase. Functional outcomes were measured using behavioral evaluation scales and questionnaires at baseline, week 6 and week 12.Results: Twenty-four PD patients were included in this study, and were evenly divided into two groups. After Bonferroni adjustment, the changes in Modified Falls Efficacy Scale (MFES) and two subscales of Multi-Directional Reach Test were significantly different between two groups in the first 6-week period. In addition, the changes in Berg Balance Scale, MFES, and two subscales of Maximum Step Length were significantly different between two groups in the second 6-week period. Compared to controls, 6-week IVGB exercise intervention significantly improved different but overlapping functional outcomes in two groups of PD patients.Conclusions: The customized IVGB exercise training improves balance, postural stability and confidence in preventing falls in older adults with mild-to-moderate PD. However, this IVGB exercise doesn't have a significant impact on quality of life.

[Title]    Effect of virtual reality exercises on balance and fall in elderly people with fall risk: a randomized controlled trial.
[Journal]  BMC GERIATRICS 21(1).
[Abstract] Background: Deficient balance and fear of falling in elderly people can lead to disturbed daily activities, falling, and finally reduced quality of life. Therefore, evaluation of low-risk methods that might partially improve balance in this group of people is of utmost importance. The present study aimed to investigate the impact of Virtual Reality (VR) exercises based on Xbox Kinect on balance and fear of falling among elderly people.Methods: This clinical trial was performed on 60 elderly individuals living in nursing homes divided into two groups of control and Xbox. The participants in the intervention group received VR exercises based on Xbox Kinect in form of two 30-45-min sessions held on a weekly basis for 6 weeks. The individuals in the control group, on the other hand, received routine exercises of the nursing homes. The research tools used in this study included a demographic questionnaire, the Berg Balance Scale (BBS), the Timed Up and Go (TUG) test, and the Falling Efficacy Scale (FES).Results: The findings of the current study demonstrated that the scores of BBS and TUG test as the indices of balance among elderly people improved significantly in the Xbox group after the intervention (p < 0.001 for both BBS and TUG test). Moreover, the score of fear of falling diminished significantly in the intervention group compared to the control group (p < 0.001).Conclusion: According to the results of the present investigation, 6 weeks of VR balance exercises could enhance balance and fear of falling among elderly people living in nursing homes.

[Title]    Physiotherapy Programmes Aided by VR Solutions Applied to the Seniors Affected by Functional Capacity Impairment: Randomised Controlled Trial.
[Journal]  INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL RESEARCH AND PUBLIC HEALTH 19(10).
[Abstract] Modern technologies are presently harnessed in response to a complex challenge of providing physiotherapeutic management in older adults. Fully immersive virtual reality (VR) solutions are acknowledged to viably enhance the overall effectiveness of traditional physiotherapeutic methods. A total of 60 community-dwelling older adults (over 75 years of age) were recruited for the study protocol. They were subsequently randomly split into four equally sized study groups (VR, CVR, OCULUS, and the classic programme group (OTAGO), and the physiotherapy sessions were pursued in the subjects' homes for 3 weeks, 3 times a week, for 30 min in each group. At the first measurement point, respective study groups differed significantly in functional performance, as expressed in gait (POMA G) and individual static balance. The post hoc analysis indicated significantly higher scores in POMA G for the classic programme group vs. the results of the VR and CVR groups. On the other hand, the OCULUS group held significantly higher scores in individual balance and TUG, as compared to the other groups (p < 0.001). Making use of a virtual reality (VR) environment in the physiotherapeutic management of community-dwelling older adults appreciably enhanced individual functional performance, especially in terms of static balance. Physiotherapy management aided by VR technology solutions offers a viable alternative to traditional physiotherapeutic regimens (e.g., OTAGO programme) in enhancing individual functional performance. The innovatively self-designed VIRTUAL REALITY COMPREHENSIVE REHABILITATION ROOMS (VRCRR) solution may help out in pursuing a complex physiotherapy programme on an individual basis within one's own home environment.

[Title]    The Effects of Physiotherapy Programmes, Aided by Virtual Reality Solutions, on Balance in Older Women: A Randomised Controlled Trial.
[Journal]  JOURNAL OF CLINICAL MEDICINE 13(21).
[Abstract] Background: Modern technologies are being applied to maintain and improve the functional performance of older adults. Fully immersive virtual reality (VR) combined with a scope of dual-task (DT) activities may effectively complement conventional physiotherapy programmes for seniors. The study aimed to compare the effectiveness of a fully immersive virtual reality (VR) environment combined with a scope of dual-task activities regarding balance in older women. Methods: Eighty women were recruited to the study protocol and, following randomisation, allocated to two equally sized groups, one pursuing conventional OTAGO exercises, the other one the VR-solutions-aided exercise programme combined with a scope of DT activities. Physiotherapy sessions spanned 6 weeks, each one lasting 60 min, three times a week, in both groups. Results: Homogeneity analysis of both study groups indicated no statistically significant differences at the first measurement point. After the intervention, both study groups achieved significantly improved scores on all tests. The VR + DT group obtained better results in dual-task gait and single-leg standing, whereas the greatest difference was observed during SLS CL (1.52 s vs. 2.33 s-difference 0.81 s 53.2% change, p = 0.001). The OTAGO group performed better in the TUG single-task gait (11.35 s vs. 12.60 s, p < 0.001) and in the Berg balance scale. Conclusions: The VR + DT training is effective in improving individual balance as well as in reducing fall risks. VR-assisted physiotherapy should complement conventional physiotherapy programmes (e.g., OTAGO). The benefits of applying VR solutions indicate that older women might well use this form of activity regularly under the guidance of a therapist or a family member.

[Title]    Interactive Cognitive Motor Training: A Promising Approach for Sustainable Improvement of Balance in Older Adults.
[Journal]  SUSTAINABILITY 15(18).
[Abstract] Physical exercise has been shown to improve balance, gait, and cognitive function in older adults. Interactive cognitive-motor training (ICMT) combines physical exercise and cognitive stimulation, but few studies have focused on the effect of ICMT on static and dynamic balance in older adults. This study aims to improve the balance of older adults to reduce fall-related injuries for sustainable development goals. We randomly assigned 38 older adults to either the ICMT group (n = 22) or the control group (n = 16). The ICMT group participated in 60-min exercise sessions three times a week for 12 weeks, while the control group maintained their regular activities. The static and dynamic balances were assessed before and after the intervention. The results indicated the ICMT group demonstrated significant improvements in static balance, specifically in swing path and velocity (V) in the medial-lateral (M-L) direction with eyes open (p < 0.05). With eyes closed, the ICMT group showed significant improvements in total swing path and area compared to the control group (p < 0.05). In dynamic balance, there was a significant difference in the lateral (L) angle limit of stability (LOS) between the ICMT group and the control group (p < 0.05). In conclusion, ICMT effectively enhances static balance and maintains dynamic balance in older adults.

[Title]    The effect of virtual reality technology on anti-fall ability and bone mineral density of the elderly with osteoporosis in an elderly care institution.
[Journal]  EUROPEAN JOURNAL OF MEDICAL RESEARCH 28(1).
[Abstract] ObjectiveTo explore the impact of virtual reality (VR) training on anti-fall ability and bone mineral density (BMD) among elderly patients admitted to a healthcare institution.MethodsPeople (aged 50) with osteoporosis in an elderly care institution in Anhui Province June 2020 to October 2021 were selected and randomly divided into VR group (n = 25) and control group (n = 25). In VR group, the virtual reality rehabilitation training system was used for training, while control group was treated with traditional fall prevention exercise intervention. The changes of Berg Balance Scale (BBS), timed up and go test (TUGT), functional gait assessment (FGA), bone mineral density (BMD) and falls during 12 months of training were compared between the two groups.ResultsBBS and FGA were positively correlated with BMD of the lumbar vertebrae and femoral neck, and TUGT was negatively correlated with BMD of the lumbar vertebrae and femoral neck. After 12 months of training, the BBS score, TUGT evaluation and FGA evaluation of the two groups were significantly improved compared with those prior to training (P < 0.05). However, there was no significant difference in the lumbar spine and femoral neck BMD between the two groups 6 months after the intervention. The femoral neck and lumbar spine BMD of the VR group improved, and it was significantly higher than that of the control group 12 months after the intervention. Nevertheless, there was no significant difference in terms of the incidence of adverse events between the two groups.ConclusionVR training can improve anti-fall ability and increase femoral neck and lumbar spine BMD and can effectively prevent and reduce the risk of injury among elderly people with osteoporosis.

[Title]    Effects of Exergame and Aerobic Dance on Improvement of Physical Fitness and Balance Ability in Older Adults:A Comparative Study.
[Journal]  Journal of Medical Biomechanics 38(4): 784-790.
[Abstract] Objective To study the effects of exergame and aerobic dance on improvement of physical fitness and balance ability in older adults. Methods A total of 40 older adults were randomly assigned to the exergame group or aerobic dance group. Both groups received moderate to high intensity exercise training for 12 weeks. Physical fitness and balance ability were measured in both groups before and after the exercise intervention. Results Compared with aerobic dance group, lung capacity (P<0.05, d =0.85), and diastolic blood pressure (P<0.05, d =-0.24) in exergame group were significantly improved. The exergame group had better performance in sway area during static balance test (d = -0.57), as well as in the rear (d = -0.70), right front upward (d = -0.67) motor control ability during dynamic balance test. Compared with exergame group, aerobic dance group had more improvement in performance of standing on one foot with eyes closed (d = -0.61) and left-sided upward motor control ability during dynamic balance test (d = 1.14). Conclusions Compared with aerobic dance, exergame has more advantages in enhancing physical fitness and maintaining balance ability in older adults, which can be used as an important way of physical exercises in older adults, so as to further improve their health and prevent the occurrence of fall injuries.

[Title]    Acute effects of virtual reality treadmill training on gait and cognition in older adults: A randomized controlled trial.
[Journal]  PLOS ONE 17(11).
[Abstract] Introduction Everyday walking often involves walking with divided attention (i.e., dual-tasking). Exercise interventions for older adults should mimic these simultaneous physical and cognitive demands. This proof-of-concept study had a two-fold purpose: 1) identify acute cognitive and gait benefits of a single session of virtual reality treadmill training (VRTT), relative to conventional treadmill training (CTT), and 2) identify differences between those who reduced dual-task costs (i.e., responders) on gait or cognition and those who did not, after the session.Methods Sixty older adults were randomized to complete a single 30-minute session of VRTT (n = 30, 71.26.5 years, 22 females) or CTT (n = 30, 72.07.7 years, 21 females). Pre- and post-exercise session, participants performed single-task walking, single-task cognitive, and dual-task walking trials while gait and cognition were recorded. Gait variables were gait speed and gait speed variability. Cognition variables were response reaction time, response accuracy, and cognitive throughput. Dual-task effects (DTE) on gait and cognition variables were also calculated.Results Post-exercise, there were no group differences (all p>0.05). During single- and dual-task trials, both groups walked faster (single-task: F(1, 58) = 9.560, p = 0.003; dual-task: F(1, 58) = 19.228, p<0.001), responded more quickly (single-task: F(1, 58) = 5.054, p = 0.028; dual-task: F(1, 58) = 8.543, p = 0.005), and reduced cognitive throughput (single-task: F(1, 58) = 6.425, p = 0.014; dual-task: F(1, 58) = 28.152, p<0.001). Both groups also exhibited reduced DTE on gait speed (F(1, 58) = 8.066, p = 0.006), response accuracy (F(1, 58) = 4.123, p = 0.047), and cognitive throughput (F(1, 58) = 6.807, p = 0.012). Gait responders and non-responders did not differ (all p>0.05), but cognitive responders completed fewer years of education (t(58) = 2.114, p = 0.039) and better information processing speed (t(58) = -2.265, p = 0.027) than cognitive non-responders.Conclusions The results indicate that both VRTT and CTT may acutely improve gait and cognition. Therefore, older adults will likely benefit from participating in either type of exercise. The study also provides evidence that baseline cognition can impact training effects on DTE on cognition.

[Journal]  The Journal of Korean Society of Physical Therapy 26(6): 430-435.
[Abstract] Purpose: The objective of this study was a virtual reality-based balance training program effective for improvement in physicalfunction, examined the balance ability and fall efficacy of elderly women with experienced falls, intending to examine theprogram’ s usefulness as an exercise program to prevent the recurrence of a fall.Methods: The participants were 30 elderly women aged 65 or older who met the conditions. The participants were randomlyassigned to either a balance training group (BT) or a virtual reality-based balance training group (VT) and received the trainingthree times per week, 30 minutes per day, for six weeks. To measure static balance, the Tetrax Portable Multiple System (TetraxLtd, Israel) were used. To measure dynamic balance, the Berg Balance Scale (BBS) and functional reach test (FRT) was used, andregarding fall efficacy, the Korean Fall Efficacy Scale (K-FES) was used.Results: Tetrax significantly improved after the intervention in both the BT group and the VT group (p<0.05). The comparisonbetween the two groups was not significantly. BBS and FRT result significantly improved after the intervention in both the BT andVT groups (p<0.001), while K-FES was significantly ameliorated in the VT group only (p<.05). Comparing the groups, there weremore significant changes in the BBS (p<0.05) and FRT (p<0.01) result of the VT group than the BT group.Conclusion: A virtual reality-based balance training program is considered to be usable as an exercise program to preventrecurrence of falls in elderly women.
